If we don't ask how long they last, but instead ask, what's the probability that there have been any civilizations at all no matter how long they lasted? I'm not asking whether they exist now or not. I'm just asking in general, about probabilities to make a technological civilization anywhere and at any time in the history of the universe. And that we were able to constrain. And so what we found was basically that the There have been ten billion trillion habitable zone planets in the universe. And what that means is that are those are ten billion trillion experiments that have been run. And the only way that we're the only time that this is, you know, this whole process from, you know, a biogenesis to a civilization has occurred is if every one of those experiments failed. Right? So therefore, you could put a a probability, you could we called it the pessimism line. Right? We don't really know what nature sets for the probability of making intelligent civilizations. Right? But we could set a limit using this. We could say, look, as if the probability per habitable zone planet is less than ten to the minus twenty two, one in ten billion trillion. Then yeah, we're alone. If it's anywhere larger than that, then they're we're not the first. It's happened somewhere else. And to me, that was an that was mind blowing. Doesn't tell me there's anybody nearby, the galaxy could be sterile. It just told me that, like, you know, unless nature's really against, he has some bias against civilizations, we're not the first time this has happened. This has happened elsewhere over the course of cosmic history. The following is a conversation with Adam Frank an astrophysicist interested in the evolution of star systems and the search for alien civilizations in our universe. This selects human podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends. Here's Adam, Frank. You wrote a book about aliens. So the big question, how many alien civilizations are out there? Yeah. That's the question. Right? The amazing thing is that after two and a half millennia of, you know, people yelling at each other or setting each other on fire occasionally over the answer, we now actually have the capacity to answer that question. So in the next ten, twenty, thirty years, we're gonna have data relevant to the answer to that question. We're gonna have hard data finally that will, one way or the other, you know, even if we don't find anything immediately, we will have gone through a number of planets. We'll be able to start putting limits on how common life is. The one answer I can tell you, which is was an important part of the problem, is how many planets are there. Right? And just like people have been arguing about the existence of life elsewhere for two thousand five hundred years, people have been arguing about planets for the exact same amount of time. Right? You can see Aristotle yelling at Democraticists about this. You know, you can see they had very wildly different opinions about how common planets were gonna be and how unique Earth was. And that question got answered. Right? Which is pretty remarkable that in a lifetime you can have a two thousand five hundred year old question. The answer is they're everywhere. There are planets everywhere. And it was possible that planets were really rare. We didn't really understand how planets formed. And so if you go back to say the turn of the twentieth century, there was a theory that said planets formed when two stars passed by each other closely, and then material was gravitationally squeezed out. In which case, those kinds of collisions are so rare that you would expect one in a trillion stars to have planets. Instead, every star in the night sky has planets. So one of the things you've done is simulated the formation of stars. How difficult do you think it is to simulate the formation of planets, like simulator solar system. The through the entire evolution of the solar system, this is kind of a a numerical simulation sneaking up to the question of how many planets are there. That actually we're able to do now. There is, you can run simulations of the formation of planetary system. So if you run the simulation, really where you wanna start is a cloud of gas, these giant interstellar clouds of gas that may have, you know, a million times the mass of the sun in them. And so you run a simulation of that. It's turbulent. The gas is roiling and tumbling. And every now and then you get a place where the the gas is dense enough, that gravity gets hold of it, and it can pull it downwards. So you'll start to form a protostar. And a protostar is basically the young star of the, you know, this ball of gas where nuclear reactions are getting started. But it's also a disc. So you as the material falls inward, because it's everything's rotating. As it falls inward, it'll spin up, and then it'll form a disk. The material will collect in what's called an accretion disk or a protoplanetary disk. And you can simulate all of that. Once you get into the disk itself and you wanna do planets, things get a little bit more complicated, because the physics gets more complicated. Now you gotta start worrying about dust because actually dust which is just dust is the wrong word. It's smoke really. These are the tiniest bits of solids. They will coagulate in the disk to form pebbles. Right? And then the pebbles will collide to form rocks and then the rocks will form boulders etcetera etcetera. That process is super complicated, but we've been able to simulate enough of it to begin to get a handle on how planets form, how you accrete enough material to get the first proto planets or planetary embryos, as we call them. And then the next step is those things start slamming into each other to form you know, planetary sized bodies. And then the planetary body slammed into each other. Earth, the moon came about because there was a Mars sized body that slammed into the earth and basically blew off all the material that then eventually formed the moon. And all of them have different chemical compositions, different temperatures? Yeah. So the the the the temperature of the material in the disk depends on how far away you are from the star. Got it. So it decreases. Right? And so there's a really interesting point. So, like, you know, close to the star, temperatures are really high. And the only thing that can condense, that can kind of freeze out is gonna be stuff like metals. So that's why you find mercury is this giant ball of iron, basically. And then as you go further out, stuff, you know, the gas gets cooler, and now you can start getting things like water to freeze. Right? So there's something we call the snow line, which is somewhere in our solar system out around between Mars and Jupiter. And that's what the reason why the giant planets in our solar system, Jupiter Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all have huge amounts of ice in them or water and ice. Actually, Jupiter and Saturn don't have so much, but the moons do. The moons have so much water in them that there's there's oceans, right, that we've got a number of those moons have got more water on them than there's water on earth. Do you think it's possible to do that kind of simulation to have a stronger and stronger estimate of how likely an Earth like planet is Can we get the physics simulation done well enough to where we can start estimating? Like, what are the possible earth like things that could be generated? Yeah. I think we can. I think we're learning how to do that now. So, you know, one part is, like, trying to just figure out how to how planets form themselves and doing the simulations like that that cascade from dust grains up to planetary embryos, that's hard to simulate. Because it's both. You gotta do both the gas and you gotta do the dust and the dust colliding and all that physics. Once you get up to a planet sized body, then, you know, you kinda have to switch over to almost like a different kind of simulation. They're often what you're doing is you're doing, you know, sort of, you're assuming the planet is this sort of spherical ball, and then you're doing what, you know, like a one d, a radial calculation. And you're just asking like, alright, how is this thing going to? What is the structure of it gonna be? Like, am I gonna have solid iron core? Or am I gonna get a solid iron core with that liquid iron core out around it like we have on on earth? And then you get, you know, a silicate kind of a rocky mantle and then across all of those details, those are kind of beyond being able to do full three d simulations from Abonishi, from scratch. We're not there yet. How important are those details? Like the crust and the atmosphere do you think? Hugely important. So I'm part of a collaboration at the University of Rochester where we're using the giant laser. Literally, this is called the laboratory for laser energetic. We got a huge grant from the NSF to use that laser to, like, slammed tiny pieces of silica to understand what conditions are like at, you know, the center of the earth, or even more importantly, the center of super earth. Like, the most this is what's wild. The most common kind of planet in the universe we don't have in our solar system, which is amazing. Right? So the we've been able to study enough or observe enough planets now to get a sense this. You know, we pretty you know, we kinda have an idea of what whose average, whose weird. And our solar system's weird because the average planet has a mass between somewhere between a few times the mass of the earth to maybe, you know, ten times the mass of the earth. And that's exactly where there are no planets in our solar system. So the smaller ones of those we call super earths, the larger ones we call subneptunes. And they're anybody's guess. Like, we don't really know what happens to material when you're squeezed to those pressures, which is like millions tens of millions of times the the pressure on the surface of the Earth. So those details really will matter of what's going on in there because that will determine whether or not you have, say, for example, plate tectonics. We think plate tectonics may have been really important for life. On earth for the evolution of complex life on earth. So it turns out and this is sort of the next generation where we're going with the the understanding, the evolution of planets in life. It turns out that you actually have to think hard about the planetary context for life. You can't just be like, oh, there's a warm pond, you know, and then some interesting, you know, chemistry happens in the warm pond. You actually have to think about the planet as a whole and what it's gone through. In order to really understand whether a planet is a good place for life or not. Why do you think plate tectonics might be useful for the formation of complex life? There's a bunch of different things. One is that, you know, the earth went through a couple of phases of being a snowball planet. Like, we, you know, we went into a period of negotiation Mhmm. Where the pretty much the entire planet was under ice. The the oceans were frozen. You know, early on in earth's history, there was no there was barely any land. We were actually a water world. So, you know, with just a couple of Australia sized cations they call them proto continents. So those we went through these snowball earth phases. And if it wasn't for the fact that we had kind of an active plate tectonics, which had a lot of volcanism on it. We could have been locked in that forever. Like, once you get into a snowball state, a planet can be trapped there forever, which is, you know, maybe you already had life form, but then because it's so cold, you may never get anything more than just microbes. Right? So what plate tectonics does is it because it fosters more volcanism, is that you're gonna get carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere, which warms the planet up and gets you out of the the snowball Earth phase. But even more, there's even more really important things. I just finished a paper where we were looking at something called the hard steps model, which is this model that's been out there for a long time that purports to say Intelligent life universe will be really rare. And it made all these assumptions about the earth's history, particularly at the history of life and the history of the planet or have nothing to do with each other. And it turns out, and as I was doing the reading for this, that earth probably early on had a had a more mild form of clay tectonics and then somewhere about a billion years ago it ramped up. And that ramping up changed everything on the planet because here's a funny thing. The earth used to be flat. What I mean by that. Right? It's all the flat earthers out there can get excited for one sec lipid. What I mean by that is that there really weren't many mountain ranges. Right? The beginning of I think the term is oroGenesis, mountain building, the true Himalayan style giant mountains didn't happen until this more robust form of plate tectonic where the plates are really being driven around the planet. And that is when you get the crusts hitting each other and they start pushing, you know, into these Himalayan style mountains. The weathering of that, the erosion of that, puts huge amounts of nutrients, you know, things that microbes wanna use, into the oceans, and then the what we call the net primary productivity, the, you know, the photo the the the bottom of the food chain. How much sugars they are producing, how much photosynthesis they're doing, shot up by a factor of almost a thousand. Right? So the the fact that you had plate tectonics supercharged evolution in some sense. You know, like, we're not exactly sure how how it happened, but it's clear that The amount of life, the amount of living activity that was happening, really got a boost from the fact that suddenly there was plate this new vigorous form of plate tectonics. So it's nice to have turmoil in terms of temperature, in terms of surface geometries in terms of the chemistry of the planet turmoil. Yeah. That's actually really true because what happens is if you look at the history of life, that's a really that's an excellent point you're bringing up. If you look at the history of life on Earth, we get, you know, a biogenesis somewhere around at least three point eight billion years ago. And that's the first microbes. They kinda take over enough that they really do you get a biosphere. You get a biosphere that is actively changing the planet. But then you go through this period, they call the boring billion. We're like it's a billion years and it's just microbes. Nothing's happening. It's just microbes. I mean, they're they're microbes are doing amazing things. They're inventing fermentation. Thank you very much. We appreciate that. But it's not until sort of you get probably these these continents slamming into each other, you really get the beginning of continents forming and driving changes. That evolution has to respond to, that on a planetary scale, this turmoil, this chaos, is creating new niches as well as closing other ones. And biology, evolution has to respond to that. And somewhere around there is when you get the Cambrian explosions. It's when suddenly every body plan, you know, evolution goes on an orgy, essentially. So, yeah, it does look like the that chaos or that turmoil was actually very helpful to evolution. I wonder if there is some extremely elevated levels of chaos, almost like catastrophes behind every leap of evolution. Like, you're not gonna have leaps. Like, in in in human societies, we have, like, an Einstein that comes up with a good idea. But it feels like on an evolutionary timescale, you need some real big drama going on for for the evolutionary system to have to come up to a solution to that drama, like an extra complex solution to that drama. Well, I think what's I'm not sure if that's I don't know if it needs to be, like, an an almost extinction event. Right? Because it's certainly true that we have gone through almost extinction events. Right? We've had, you know, five mass extinctions. But you don't necessarily see that, like, there was this giant evolutionary leap happening, right, after those. So, you know, with the comet impact, the KT Boundary. Certainly, you know, lots of niches opened up. And that's why we're here. Right? Because, you know, our ancestors were just little basically rodents rats living under the footsteps of the dinosaurs. And it was that common impact that opened the route for us. But it wasn't I mean, that still took another, you know, sixty five million years. It wasn't like this thing immediately happened. But what we found with this hard steps paper because the whole idea of the hard steps paper was it was one of these anthropic reasoning kinds of things where Brandon Carter said, oh, look, the intelligence doesn't show up on earth Mhmm. Until about, you know, almost close to when the end of the sun's lifetime. And so he's like, well, there should be no reason why the sun's lifetime. And the time for evolution to produce intelligence should be the same. And so, therefore, and he goes through all this reasoning, and and and he ends up with the idea that, like, oh, it must be that the odds of getting intelligence are super low. And so that's the hard steps. Right? So there was a series of steps in evolution that were, you know, very, very hard. And because that you can calculate some probability distributions Mhmm. And everybody loves a good probability distribution, and they went a long way with this. But it turns out that the whole thing is flawed. Because on one you know, when you look at it, of course, the time scale for the sun's evolution and the time scale for evolution on life are coupled because life and the the the timescale for evolution of the earth is coupled, is about the same timescale as the evolution as the sun. It's billions of years. The earth evolves over billions of years. And life and the earth coevolve. That's what Brandon Carter didn't see is that actually the fate of the Earth and the fate of life are trickably combined. And this is really important for astrobiology too. Life doesn't happen on a planet. It happens to a planet. So this is something that David Grinspoon and Sarah Walker both say and, you know, I agree with this. It's a really nice way of putting it. So, you know, play tectonics, the evolution of oxygen, of an oxygen atmosphere, which only happen because of life. These things, you know, these are are things that are happening where life and the planet are sort of sloshing back and forth. And so rather than to your your point about you need giant catastrophes, maybe not giant catastrophes, but what happens is as the earth and life are evolving together, windows are opening up, evolutionary windows. Like for example, life put oxygen into the atmosphere. When when life invented this new form of photosynthesis about two and a half billion years ago, that broke water apart to, you know, work to do its its chemical shenanigans. It broke water apart and pushed oxygen into the atmosphere. That's why there's oxygen in the atmosphere. It's only because of life. That opened up huge possibilities, new spaces for evolution to happen. But it also changed the chemistry of the planet forever. So the evolution the introduction of of oxygen photosynthesis changed the planet forever, and it opened up a bunch of windows for evolution that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Like for example, you and I, we need that amount of oxygen big brain creatures need an oxygen rich atmosphere because oxygen is so potent for metabolism. So you couldn't get intelligent creatures a hundred million years after the planet formed. So really, on a scale of a planet, when there's billions, trillions of organisms on a planet, they can actually have planetary scale impact. Yes. So the chemical shenanigans of an individual organism once scaled out to trillions can actually change a planet. Yeah. And we know this for a fact now, like this is so there is this thing GAIA theory that, you know, with James LoveLock introduced in the seventies. And then Lynn Margiela a biologist and Margolis together. So this with Gaia theory was the idea that planets pretty much take or, sorry, life takes over a planet. Life hijacks the planet in a way that the sum total of life creates these feedbacks between the planet and the life such that it keeps the planet habitable. It's kind of a homeostasis. Right? I can go out like right now outside. It's a hundred degrees. Right? And I go outside, but my internal temperature is gonna the same. And I can go back to, you know, Rochester, New York in the winter, and it's gonna be, you know, zero degrees. But my internal temperature is gonna be the same. That's homeostasis. The idea of Gaia theory was that life the biosphere exerts this pressure on the planet or these feedbacks on the planet. That even as other things are changing, the planet will always stay in the right kinds of conditions for life. And now when this theory came out, it was very controversial. People were like, oh my god. You know what are you smoking weed? You know? And like, there were all these guy in festivals with guy in dances. And so, you know, became very popular in the new age community. But LoveLock actually, they were able to show that, no, this has nothing to do with, like, the planet being conscious or anything. It was about these feedbacks that that by the biology, the biosphere can exert these feedbacks And now that's become whether or not it's still we're still unclear whether there are true guy in feedbacks in the sense that the planet can really exert complete control. But it is absolutely true that the biosphere is a major player in Earth's history. So the biosphere fights for homeostasis on Earth. The bi so okay. What I would say right now is, I don't know if I can say that scientifically. I can certainly say that the biosphere does a huge amount of the regulation of the planetary state. And over billions of years, has strongly modified the evolution of the planet. So whether or not a a true guy in feedback would be exactly what you said. Right? The guy the biosphere is this somehow and Sarah Walker and David Grinspoon and I actually did a paper on this about the idea of planetary intelligence or cognition across a planetary scale. And I think that actually is possible. It's not conscious, but there is a kind of cognitive activity going on. The biosphere in some sense knows what is happening because of these feedbacks. So but so it's still unclear whether we have these full guy in feedbacks, but it we certainly have semi guy in feedbacks. If there's a perturbation on the planetary scale, temperature, you know, installation, how much sunlight's coming in, the biosphere will start to have feedbacks. That will damp that perturbation. Temperature goes up, the biosphere starts doing something, temperature comes down. Now I wonder if the technosphere also has a guy in feedback or elements of a guy in feedback such that the technosphere will also fight some degree for homeostasis. Open question, I guess. Well, that's I'm glad you asked that question. Because that that that paper that David and Sarah and I wrote, what we were arguing was, is that over the history of a planet, right, when life first forms, you know, three point eight billion years ago, it's kinda thin on the ground. Right? You've got the first species, you know, these are all microbes. And they have not yet they're not gonna enough of them to exert any kind of these giant feedback. So we call that an immature biosphere. Mhmm. But then as time goes on, as life becomes more robust, and it begins to exert these feedbacks, keeping the planet in the place where it needs to be for life. We call that a mature biosphere. Right? And the important thing and we're gonna I'm sure later on, we're gonna talk about definitions of life and such. There's this great term called autoapoies that Francisco Varella, neurobiologist, Francisco Varella came up with. He said, you know, one of the defining things about life is this property of auto poeces, which means self creating and self maintaining. Life does not create the conditions which will destroy itself. Right? It's always trying to keep itself in a place where it can stay alive. So the biosphere from this guy in perspective has been auto poetic for billions of years. Now we just invented this technosphere in the last, you know, couple of hundred years. And what we were arguing in that paper is that it's an immature technosphere. Right? Because right now with climate change and all the other things we're doing, we don't we're destroyed. The technosphere right now is sort of destroying the conditions under which it needs to maintain itself. So the real job for us, if we're gonna last over you know, geologic timescales. If we want a technosphere that's gonna last tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of years, then we've got to become mature, which means to not undermine the conditions to not subvert the conditions that you need to stay alive. So as of right now, I'd say we're not auto poetic. Well, I wonder if we look across thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years that perturbations. The technosphere should create perturbations as a way for developing greater and greater defenses against perturbations, which Sounds like a ridiculous statement, but basically go out and play in the yard and hurt yourself to to strengthen the or, like, drink water from the from the pond. From the pond. Yeah. Right? To just stick a few times. To strengthen the immune system. Yeah. Well, you know, what's interesting with the technosphere? We could talk about this more, but, like, you know, the we're just emerging as a technosphere in terms of as a interplanetary technosphere. Right? That's really the next step for us is to David Greenspan talks about Loveus said, do you have anti accretion? Like this amazing thing that for the first time, you know, over the entire history of the planet, stuff is coming off the planet. Right? Used to be everything just fell down. All the meteorites fell down. But now we're starting to push stuff out. And, you know, like the idea of planetary defense or such, you know, we are actually gonna start exerting perturbations on the solar system as a whole. We're gonna start engineer if we make it. Right? I I always like to say that if we can get through climate change, the prize at the end is the solar system. Mhmm. Right? So we will will be changed literally engineering the solar system. But what you can think of right now with what's happening with the anthropocene, the great acceleration that that is the techno sphere. You know, is the creation of it. That is a giant perturbation on the biosphere. Right? And what you can't do is, you know, the technosphere sits on top of the biosphere. And the technosphere, if the technosphere undermines the biosphere, for its own conditions of habitability, then you're in trouble. Right? I mean, the biosphere is not going away. There's nothing we could do. Like, the idea that we have to save the earth is a little ridiculous. Like, the earth is not a furry little bunny that we need to present. But it's the conditions for us. Right? We humanity emerged out of this out of the holocene, the last ten thousand years interglacial period. We can't tolerate very different kinds of earths. So that's what I mean about a perturbation. Before we forget, I gotta ask you about this paper. Right. Pretty interesting. It's an interesting table here about heartsteps, a biogenesis, glucose fermentation, tuporavic acid, all kinds of steps all the way to homo sapiens, animal intelligence, land ecosystems, endoskeletons, eye precursor. So formation of the eye Yeah. Complex multicellularity. That's definitely one of the big ones. Yeah. So interesting. I mean, what can you say about this chart? There are all kinds of papers talking about what the difficulty of these steps. Right. And so this was the idea. So what Carter said was, you know, we're using endropic reasoning. He said there must be a few very hard steps. For the evolution to get through to make it to intelligence. Right? So there's some steps are gonna be easy, so every generation, you know, you roll the dice. And, yeah, it won't take long for you to get that step. But there must be a few of them. And he said you could even calculate what how many there were, five, six, in order to get to intelligence. And so this paper here, this plot is all these different people who've written all these papers, and this is the point actually you can see all these papers that were written on the hard steps. Each one proposing a different set of what those steps should be. And there's this other idea from biology of the major transitions in evolution MTEs that those were the hard steps. But what we actually found was that none of those are actually hard. The whole idea of hard steps that there are hard steps is actually suspect. So, you know, this what's amazing about this model is it shows how important it is to actually work with people who are in the field. Right? So, you know, Brandon Carter was a, you know, brilliant physicist. The guy who came up with this. And then lots of physicists and astrophysicist like me have used this, but the people who actually study evolution and the planet Mhmm. Were never involved. Right? And if you went and talk to an evolutionary biologist or a bio geophysicist, they'd look at you when you explain this to the man, they'd be like, what? Like, what are you guys doing? Turns out none of the details or none of the conceptual structure of this matches with what the people actually study the planet and its evolution. Is it mostly about the the fact that there's not really discrete big steps? Is this gradual, continual kind of process? Well, there's two things. The first most important one was that the planet and the biosphere have evolved together. Yeah. That's something that every, you know, most biophysicist completely accept. And it was the first thing that Carter kind of rejected. He said, like, you know, that's probably not possible. And yet, you know, like, if he'd only sort of had more discussions with this other community, it would have seemed like, no. There there are actually windows that open up. And then the next thing is this idea of whether a step is hard or not. Because for hard, what what you mean by a hard step is that, like I said, every time there's a generation, every time there's a next generation born, you're rolling a dice on whether this mutation will happen. And the idea of something being a hard step, there's two ways in which something might even peer as a hard step and not be or actually not be a hard step at all. One is that you see something that has occurred in evolution that has only happened once. Right? So let's take the opposite. We should see something that's happened multiple times, like wings. Lots of examples of wings over lots of different evolutionary lineages. So that's clearly not a hot. Making wings is not a hard step. There are certain other things that people say no, that's a hard step oxygen, you know, the oxygen photosynthesis. But they are so they tend to be so long ago that we've lost all the information. There could be other things in the fossil record that, you know, went made this innovation, but they're just gone now. So you can't tell. So there's information lost. The other thing is the idea of pulling up the ladder that somebody, you know, some species makes the innovation, but then it fills the niche and nobody else can do it again. So yeah, it only happened once, but it happened once because basically the the the creature was so successful. It took over and there was no space for anybody else to evolve it. So, yeah, so the interesting thing about this was seeing how how much once you look at the details of life's history on earth, how it really shifts you away from this hard steps model. And it shows you that those details, as we're talking about, like, with you have to know about the planet? Do you have to know about plate tectonics? Yeah. You're going to have to. I mean, you'd be fair to Carton. The first point, it makes it much more complicated if life and the planet are co evolving. Because it's not it would be nice to consider the planet as a static thing that sets the initial conditions. Yep. And then we can sort of, from a outside perspective, analyze planets based on the initial conditions they create. And then then there's a binary yes or no, it will create life. But if they cobalt, it's just a it's a really complex dynamical system where everything is becomes much more difficult from the perspective of SETI of looking out there and trying to figure out which ones Yeah. Are actually producing life. But I think we're at the point now. So now there may be other kinds of principles that actually because your coevolution actually has its own not deterministic. You're done with determinism. Right? But but you but complex systems have patterns. Complex systems have constraints. And that's actually what we're gonna be looking for or or constraints on them. And so, you know, and again, nothing against Carter was a brilliant idea. But it just goes to show. You know, this is great x d c. Yeah. I'm a theoretical physicist. Right? And I so I love simplify give me a simplified model with, you know, it's a a a dynamical equation, some initial conditions, I'm very happy. But there's this great x d c comic where, like, you know, somebody's working something out on the board. And this physics assist is looking over and saying, oh oh, I just I just wrote down an equation for that. I I solved your problem. Do you guys even have a journal for this? You know, subtitles is why everybody hates physicists. Yeah. So sometimes that approach totally works. Sometimes physicists can be very good at, like, zooming in on what is important and casting the details aside, so you can get to the heart of an issue. And that's very useful sometimes. Other times, it opts you skates. Right? Other times, it clouds over actually what you needed to focus on, especially when it comes to complexity. Speaking of simplifying everything down to an equation, let's return back to the question of how many alien civilizations are out there and talk about the Drake equation. Yeah. Can you explain the Drake equation? You know, people have various feelings about the Drake equation. You know, it can be abused. But basically, it was the the story actually is really interesting. So Frank Drake Mhmm. In nineteen sixty does the first ever astrobiological experiment. He gets a radio telescope pointed at a couple of stars. And listens for signals. That was the first time anybody done any experiment about any kind of life in the history of humanity. And he does it, and he's kinda waiting for everybody to make fun of him. Instead, he gets a phone call from the government says, hey, we want you to do a a meeting on interstellar communications. Right? So he's like, okay. So they organize a meeting, like, just eight people, a young Carl Sagan, is gonna be there as well. And like the night before, Drake has to come up with a an agenda. You come up with an agenda for a meeting on a topic that no one's ever talked about before? Right? And so he actually he breaks what he does, what's so brilliant about the Drake equation is he breaks the problem of how many civilizations are out there into a bunch of sub problems. Right? And he breaks it into seven subproblems. Each one of them is a factor in an equation that when you multiply them all together, you get the number of civilizations out there that we could communicate with. So the first term is the rate at which stars form. The second term is the fraction of those stars that have planets, f and p. The next term is the number of planets in the habitable zone, the place where we think life could form. The next term after that is the fraction of those planets where actually an a biogenesis event life forms occurs. The next one is the fraction of planets on which you start to get intelligence. After that, it's the fraction of planets where that intelligence goes on to create a civilization. And then finally, the last term, which is the one that we really care about, is the lifetime. How long you have a civilization? Now how long does it last? Well, you say we we humans. We humans. Right? Because we're standing. We're staring at the, you know, multiple guns pointing at the, you know, nuclear war, climate change, AI. So, you know, how long on in general does civilizations last? Now, each one of these terms was brilliant about what he did was what he was doing was he was quantifying our ignorance. Right? By breaking the problem up into these seven subproblems, he gave astronomers something to do. Right? And so, you know, this is always with a new research field. You need a research program or else you just have a bunch of vague questions. You don't even know really what you're trying to do. So, you know, the star people could figure out how many stars were forming per year. The the people were in and planets could go and find techniques to discover planets, etcetera, etcetera. I mean, these are their own fields. Essentially, by creating this equation, he's launching new fields. Yeah. That's exactly he gave astrobiology, which wasn't even a term then. A road map. Like, okay, you guys go do this, you go do that, you go do that, and it had such far reaching effect on astrobiology because it did break the problem up in a way that gave useful, you know, sort of marching orders for all these different groups. Like, for example, it's because of the Drake equation in some sense that people who were involved in SETI pushed NASA to develop the technologies for planet hunting. There was this amazing meeting in nineteen seventy eight, nineteen two meetings. Nineteen seventy eight and nineteen seventy nine that were driven in some part by the people who were involved in SETI getting NASA together to say, look, okay, look, how you know, what's what's the roadmap for us to develop technologies defined? Find planets. So yeah. So, you know, the Drake equation is absolutely foundational for astrobiology. But we should remember that it's not a law of nature. Right? It's not something that's it's not equals m c squared. And so you can see it being abused in some sense, people, you know, that generated a trillion paper. Some of those papers are good. I've written some of those and some of those papers are bad. You know, I'm not sure where my paper fits in on those. So I'm saying, you know, one should be careful about what you're using it for. But in terms of understanding the problem that that astrobiology faces, this really broke it up in a useful way. We could talk about each one of these, but let let's just look at planets. Yeah. So that's a really interesting one. I think when you look back, you know, hundreds of years from now, what's in the nineties when they first detected the first Ninety two and ninety five ninety five to me was really that was the discovery of the first planet orbiting a sun like star. To me, that was the water, the dam being broken. I I think that's like one of the greatest discoveries in the in the history of science. I agree. I agree. Right now, I guess nobody's celebrating it. Too much because you don't know what it really means. But I think once we almost certainly will find life out there, it will obviously allow us to generalize across the entire galaxy, the entire universe. So if you can find life on a planet even in the solar system, you can now start generalizing across the entire universe. You can. All you need is one like, right now, it's an any you know, our understanding of life, we have one example. We have n equals one example of life. So that means we could be an accident. Right? It could be that we're the only place in the entire universe where this weird thing called life has occurred. Get one more example and now you're done. Because if you have one more example, now you're you know, you don't have to find all the other examples. You just know that it's happened more than once And now you are, you know, in from a bayesian perspective, you can start thinking like, yeah. Yeah. This life is not something that's hard to make. Well, let me get your sense of estimates for the trick equation. You're also reading a paper expanding on the trick equation, but what what do you what do you think is the answer? So the paper there was this paper we wrote Woody Sullivan and I in twenty sixteen, where we said, look, we have all this exoplanet data now. Right? The so the thing that exoplanet science and the exoplanet census I was talking about before have nailed is f sub p, the fraction of stars that have planets, it's one. Every freaking star that you see in this guy hosts a family of worlds. I mean, it's mind boggling. Because every one of those those are all places Right? They're either, you know, gas giants probably with moons. So there's the moons are places you can stand and look out. Or they're like terrestrial worlds where even if there's not life, there's still snowfall and there's oceans washing up on, you know, on shorelines. It's incredible to think how many places and stories there are out there. So, right, the first term was f sub p, which is how many stars have planets. The next term is how many planets are in the habitable zone, right, on average. And it turns out to be one over five. Right? So, you know, you know, around point two. So that means you just count five of them. Go out at night and go one, two, three, four, five. One of them has an an earth like planet, you know, in the habitable zone, like, whoa. So what what defines a habitable rubble zone. Habitable zone is an idea that was developed in the nineteen fifty eight by the Chinese American astronomer Shu Chang. And it was it was a brilliant idea. It said, look, this is their you know, I can do this simple calculation. If I take a planet and just stick it at some distance from a star of what's the temperature of the planet? What's the temperature of the surface? So now you're all gonna ask you, give it a standard kind of, you know, Earth like atmosphere and ask, could there be liquid water on the surface? Right? We believe that liquid water is really important for life. There could be other things that's happening fine, but, you know, if you were to start off trying to make life, you'd probably choose water as your solvent for it. So basically, the habitable zone is the band of orbits around a star where you can have liquid water. On the surface, you could take up, you know, glass of water, pour it on the surface and it would just pull up. It wouldn't freeze immediately, which would happen if your planet is too far out, and it wouldn't just boil away if your planet's too close in. So that's the formal definition of the habitable zone. So it's a nice strict definition. There's probably way more going on than that, but this is a place to start. Right. What we should say, it's a place to start. I I do think it's too strict of a constraint. I would agree. We're talking about temperature where water could be on the surface. There there's so many other ways to get the aforementioned turmoil Yeah. Where the temperature varies, whether it's volcanic, So interaction of volcanoes and ice and all of this on the moons of plants that are much farther away, all this kind of stuff. Yeah. Well, for example, we know in our own solar system, we have, say, Europa, the moon of Jupiter, which has got a hundred mile deep ocean under ten miles of ice. Right? That's not in the habitable zone. That is outside the habitable zone. And that may be the best place. It's got more water than Earth does. All of its oceans or, you know, it's twice as much water on Europa than there is on Earth. So, you know, that may be a really great place for life to form, and it's outside the habitable zone. So, you know, the habitable zone is a good place to start, and it helps us. And there's reason there's reasons why you do wanna focus on the habitable zone. Because like Europa, I couldn't I won't be able to see from across telescopic distances, across light years, I I wouldn't be able to see life on Europa because it's under ten miles of ice. Right? So with the important thing about planets in the habitable zone is that we're thinking they have atmospheres Atmosphere are the things we can characterize for across ten fifty light years, and we can see biosignatures as we're gonna talk about. So there is a reason why the habitable zone becomes important for the detection of extra solar life. But for me, when I look up at the stars, it's very likely that there's a habitable planet or moon in each of the stars, habitable defined broadly. Yeah. I think that's that's not unreasonable. To say. I mean, especially since the formal definition, you get one in five. Right? One in five is a lot. There's a lot of stars in this guy. So, yeah, saying that in general, when I look at a star, there's a pretty good chance that there's something habitable orbiting it is not a unreasonable scientific claim. To me, it seems like there should be alien civilizations everywhere. Why the Fermi Paradox? Why haven't we seen them? Okay. The Fermi Paradox. Let's talk about the I love talking about the Fermi Paradox because there is no Fermi Paradox. Yeah. So the Fermi Paradox, let's talk about the Fermi Paradox and the history of it. So Enrico Fermid's nineteen fifty. He's walking with his friends at Los Alamos Nuclear Weapons Lab to the Cantina. And there had been this cartoon in the New Yorker. They all read the New Yorker. And the cartoon was trying to explain why there had been this rash of garbage cans being disappearing in New York. And this cartoon said, oh, it's UFO's because this is already, you know, it's nineteen fifty. The first big UFO craze happened in forty seven. So they'd all they were laughing about this as they're walking and they started being physicists, started talking about interstellar travel, interstellar propulsion, blah blah blah. You know, conversation goes on for a while. Conversation turns to something else, you know, that gone to other things about forty minutes later over lunch. Fermi blurts out. Well, where is everybody? Right? Typical Fermi sort of thing. He'd done the calculation in his head, and he suddenly realized that, look, if one, if there you know, if intelligence is common, that even traveling at sub light speeds, a a civilization could cross, you know, kinda hop from one star system to the other and spread her out across the entire galaxy in a few hundred thousand years. And he realized this and so he was like, why aren't they here now? And that was the beginning of the Fermi Paradox. It actually got picked up as a formal thing in nineteen seventy five in a paper by heart, where he actually kind of went through this calculation and showed and said, well, there's nobody here now. Therefore, there's nobody anywhere that, you know. Okay. So that is what we will call the Direct Fermi Paradox. Why aren't they here now? But something happened where people after SETI began, where people started to there there's this idea of the great silence. People got this idea in their head that, like, oh, we've been looking for decades now, for signals of extraterrestrial intelligence, and we haven't found any. Therefore, there's nothing out there. But that so we'll call that the indirect Fermi Paradox. And there absolutely is no indirect Fermi Paradox for the most mundane of reasons, which is money. There's never been any money to look. They're really SETI was always done by researchers who were kinda like scabbing some time, you know, some extra time from their other projects to, you know, look a little bit at the sky where the telescope telescopes are expensive. So Jason Wright, one of my collaborators, he and his students did a study where they looked at the entire search space for SETI, you know, and imagine that's an ocean. All the different stars you have to look at, the radio frequencies you have to look at, how when you look, how often you look, and they they looked then they summed up all the setty searches that had ever been done. They went through the literature. And what they found was if the if that search space, if the sky is an ocean, and you're looking for fish, how much of the ocean have we looked at? And it turns out to be a hot tub. That's how much of the ocean that we've looked up. We've dragged and a hot tub's worth of ocean water up and there was no fish in it. And so now are we gonna say up? Well, there's no fish in the ocean. Right? So there is absolutely positively no indirect fermi parts. We just haven't looked. But we're starting to look. So that's what's, you know, finally, we're starting to look. That's what's exciting. The direct Fermi Paradox, there are so many ways out of that. Right? There's a book called seventy seven solutions to the Fermi Paradox that it just yeah. You can pick your favorite one. It just doesn't carry a lot of weight because there's so many ways around it. We did an actual simulation, my group, Johnson Carol, one of my collaborators. We actually simulated the galaxy, and we simulated probes moving at sub light speed from one star to the other. Gathering resources heading to the next one. And so we could actually track the expansion wave across the galaxy, have one I a biogenesis event, and then watch the whole galaxy get colonized or settled. And it is absolutely true that that wave crosses, you know, heart was right, Fermi was right, that wave crosses very quickly. But civilizations don't last forever. Right? So one question is, when did they come to earth? Right? So if you give civilizations a finite lifetime, you know, let them last ten thousand, a hundred thousand years, what you find is you now have a steady state. Civilizations are dying. They're, you know, they're they're coming back. They're traveling between the stars. What you find then is you can have big holes opened up. You can have regions of space where there is nobody for millions of years. And so if that, if we're living in one of those, bubbles right now, then maybe we were visited, but we revisited a hundred million years ago. And there was a paper that Gavin Schmidt and I did that showed that if there was a civilization whether it was like dinosaurs or aliens that was here a hundred million years ago, there's no way to tell. There's just there's no record leftover. The fossil record is too sparse. The only way maybe you could tell us by looking at the isotopic strata to see if there was anything reminiscent of an industrial civilization. But the idea that, you know, you'd be able to find you know, iPhones or or toppled buildings after a hundred million years is there's no way. So if there was an alien camp here Yeah. An alien village, a small civilization Right? It'd be even a large civilization. Even a large civilization. Even if it was one hundred million years ago. And it lasted ten thousand years, fossil records not gonna have it. Yeah. Yeah. The fossil record is too sparse. Right? Most things don't fossilize. Ice. Yeah. And ten thousand years is a, you know, blink in the eye of geological time. So we call Gavin called this, the sialorian hypothesis after the doctor who episode with the lizard creatures, the sialorians. And so that that paper got a lot press, but it was a you know, it was it was an important idea. I know she was really gavens. I was just helping with the astrobiology. That to recognize that, like, yeah, you know, we we could have been visited a long time ago. There just would be no record. Yeah. It's kinda mind blowing. It's really mind blowing. Yeah. And then it's also a good reminder that we've been intelligent species have been here for a very short amount of time. Very short amount of time. Yeah. This is not to say that there was. Like, so oh, whenever I gave you though, I like, what I was on Joe Rodan for exactly this paper. And I had to always emphasize, we're not saying there was a syloriian, you know. But we're just saying that if there was, That's why I love Gavin's question. Gavin's question was just like, how could you tell? Right? It was a very beautifully scientific question. That's what we were really showing is that you really you know, unless you did a very specific kind of search, which nobody's done so far, that, you know, there would there's not an obvious way to tell that there there could have been civilizations here earlier on. I've actually been reading a lot about ancient civilizations, and it just makes me sad how much of the wisdom of that time is lost. Yeah. And how much guessing is going on, whether it's in South America? Like, what happened in the jungle? Yeah. Like the Amazon. Like, the Amazon prob that was you know, the conquistars came and wiped everybody out, and especially just even the like the plague may have decimated. So, yeah, how much of that civilization? And there's a lot of theories and, you know, because of archaeology, only looks at cities. They don't really know the origins of humans. Yeah. And there's a there's a lot of really interesting theories in there. Of course, controversial. There's a lot of controversial people in in every discipline, but archaeology is like to fastening anyone because we know so little Yeah. Basically storytellers. You're assembling the picture from just very few puzzle pieces. It's fascinating. It it makes me it's it's it's humbling, and it's sad that there could be entire civilizations. Ancient civilizations that are either almost entirely or entirely lost. Yeah. Well, like, the the the indigenous peoples of North America. There could have been, like, millions and millions. You know, we get this idea that, like, oh, you know, this the Europeans came in, it was empty, you know. But it was they have only been empty because the play gets swept up from, you know, from the what happened in mezzo America. So and, you know, and they didn't really build cities, but they had they I mean, they they didn't build wooden or stone cities. They built wooden cities. You know? Everybody seems to be building pyramids. And they're really damn good at it. Mhmm. What does that do with a pair like, what is why why does that apply? Like, what archetype in our brain is that? And it is also really interesting speaking of archetypes, is that independent civilizations formed, and they had a lot of similar kind of dynamics, like human nature when it it builds up hierarchies in a certain way, builds up myths and religions in a certain way. It builds pyramids in a certain way. Yeah. It goes to war, all this kind of stuff. Yeah. Independently Yeah. Or just fascinating. Santa Fe Institute. The stuff the Santa Fe Institute does on this as complex systems, you know, the the origin of hierarchies and such, Very cool. Yeah. Sanofi folks. Complexity in general is really cool. What phenomena emerge when a bunch of how things get together and interact? Go going back to this this paper, a new empirical constraint on the prevalence, of technological species in the universe, this paper that expands on the Drake equation. What are some interesting things in this paper? Well, so the main thing we were trying to do with this paper is say, look, we have all of this exoplanet data. Right? It's gotta be good for something. Especially since two of the terms that have been nailed down empirically, are two terms in the Drake equation. So f sub p, that's the second term, fraction of stars that have planets. And then n sub b, the average number of planets in the habitable zone. Those are the second and third term in the Drake equation. So what that means is all the astronomical terms have been nailed. And so we said, like, okay. How do we use this to do something with the Drake equation? And so we realized is, well, okay. We gotta get rid of time. The lifetime thing, we can't say anything about that. But if we let that if we don't ask how long they last, but instead ask, what's the probability that there have been any civilizations at all? No matter how long they lasted. I'm not asking whether they exist now or not. I'm just asking in general, about probabilities to make a technological civilization anywhere and at any time in the history of the universe. And that we were able to constrain. And so what we found was basically that the There have been ten billion trillion habitable zone planets in the universe. And what that means is that are those are ten billion trillion experiments that have been run. And the only way that we're the only time that this is, you know, this whole process from, you know, a biogenesis to a civilization has occurred as if every one of those experiments failed. Right? So therefore, you could put a a probability because we called it the pessimism line. Right? We don't really know what nature sets for the probability of making intelligent civilizations. Right? But we could set a limit using this. We could say, look, as if the probability per habitable zone planet is less than ten to the minus twenty two, one in ten billion trillion. Then yeah, we're alone. If it's anywhere larger than that, then they're we're not the first. It's happened somewhere else. And to me, that was an that was mind blowing. Doesn't tell me there's anybody nearby, the galaxy could be sterile. It just told me that, like, you know, unless nature's really against, you have some bias against civilizations, we're not the first time this has happened. This has happened elsewhere over the course of cosmic history. Ten billion trillion experiments. Yeah. That's a lot of experiments. It's a lot. Right. A thousand is a lot. Yeah. A hundred is a lot. Yeah. If we normal humans saw a hundred experiments and we knew that at least one time there was a successful human civilization built. I mean, we would say for sure in in a hundred you'll get another one. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I mean. That's why so this you know, these kinds of arguments you have to be careful with what they can do. But what it really I felt like what this paper showed was that, you know, the burden of proof is now on the pessimists. Right? So that's why we call it the pessimism line. There's been, you know, throughout history, there's been, you know, alien pessimists and alien optimists, and they've been yelling at each other. That's all they had to go with. Right? You know, and, like, with Jardano Bruno and sixteen hundred, they burned the guy at the stake for being an alien optimist. But nobody really knew what pessimism or optimism meant. This, you know, we sort of thought this was like the planck blank. This was sort of the planck length of astrobiology. Gave you an actual number. That, you know, if you could somehow calculate what the probability, you know, of forming a technological civilization was, this thing sort of shows you where the limit is. If as long as you're above, ten to the minus twenty two, then you actually absolutely, it has occurred. In the in the in the history. Other civilizations have occurred in the history of the universe. So to me, at least the big question is f e, which is basically a biogenesis. How hard is it for life to originate in a planet? Because all the other ones seem very likely. Everything seems very likely. The only open question to me Yeah. Is, like, how hard is it for life to originate? There's lots of ways to again, you know, we don't know unless we look. And, you know, you had Sarah walk her on not too long ago, you know, she's very interested in origins of life. So, you know, lots of people are working on this, but I think it's it's hard looking at the history of the earth, you know. And again, this is you can do bayesian arguments on this. But, yeah, it's forming life. I don't think it's hard. Getting getting like basic biology started. I don't think it's hard. It's still wild. It's an amazing process that actually I think requires some deep rethinking about how we conceptualize what life is and what life isn't. That's one of the things I like about Sarah's work. We're pursuing on a different level about the life as that the only process the only system that uses information. But still, regardless of all those kinds of details, life is probably easy to make. That's that's my that's my gut feeling, you know. Yeah. I mean, day by day, this changes. For me. But as you see, once you create bacteria, it's it's it's off to the races. Yeah. You're gonna get complex life. Yeah. As long as you have enough time, I mean, that boring billion. And but I just can't imagine a habitable planet not having a couple of billion to spare. Yeah. A couple of years to spare. You know, there is a mystery there about why did it take so long, like, with the Cambrian explosion, but that may be again about these windows. Like, it couldn't happen until until the window, the planet, and that the life had evolved together enough that they together kinda opened the window for the the next step. You know, intelligent life and how long intelligent you're still with technological civilizations. I think there's a big question about how long those last. And how, you know, I'm hopeful, you know. But but in terms of just like, I think life is absolutely gonna be common in the, you know, pretty common in the universe. Yeah. I think it's absolutely I I think, again, if I were to bet everything, Even even in advanced civilizations are common. So the to me then, the the only explanation is the l. Our galaxy is a graveyard of civilizations. Yeah. Casey, you think about it. We've only been around I mean, it's a tech a lot truly, you know, when we think about it in in Drake's definition, you have to have radio telescopes. That's been a hundred years. You know, and if we got another ten thousand, a hundred thousand years of history, that would be would for us, that'd be pretty amazing. Right? But that's still that wouldn't be long enough to really pop up the number of civilizations in the in the galaxy. So you really need it to be like hundreds of millions of years. And that raises a question which I am very interested in. Which is how do we even talk about, I call it, the billion year civilization. Right? How do we even begin to hypothesize or think about in any kind of systematic way what happens to a technological civilization across hundreds of millions to a billion years. Yeah. Like, how how do you even simulate the trajectories that civilizations can take across that kind of timescale? Yeah. When we all the data would have is just for the ten thousand years or or so, twenty thousand years that humans have been building civilizations. Yeah. And then just I don't I don't know what you put it at, but maybe a hundred years that we've been technological. Yeah. And we're ready to blow ourselves to bits or, you know, drive ourselves off the planet. Yeah. No. It's really interesting. But there's gotta be a way that I think that's really a frontier. So you had David Kipping on not too long ago. And David and I did a paper and Caleb Sharf, David really drove this. Where we you know, it was a basic calculation to sort of ask the question. If you if you were to find a detection, if you were to find a signal or, you know, a techno signature, would that come from a civilization that was younger, your age, or older? And you could see I mean, this is not hard to do, but it was great. The formalism. The formalism was hard. You know, it's kind of intuitive. But the formalism was hard to show that, yeah, they're older. You know, I'm probably much older. So that means you really do need to think about like, okay, how do billion year civilizations manifest themselves? What signatures will they leave? And yeah, can you even I mean, what's so cool about it? What's it's so much fun? Because you gotta like, you have to you have to imagine the unimaginable. Like, you know, would you still I mean, obviously, biological evolution can happen on, you know, on those kinds of time scales. So you wouldn't even really be the same thing you started out as, but social forms. What kind of social forms? Can you imagine that would be continuous? Over that or maybe they wouldn't be continue to get they drop out. You know, they destroy themselves and then they come back. So maybe it's, you know, it's a trunk or a punctuated evolution. I mean but we got a sort of this is the fun part. We have to sort of work this out. Mhmm. You know? But I mean, one way to approach that question is, like, how what are the different ways to achieve homeostasis as you get greater and greater technological innovation? So, like, if you expand out into the universe and you have optocartis, you have scale, what what are the ways you can avoid destroying yourself? Just achieve stability while still growing. Yeah. And I mean, that's an interesting question. I think it's probably simulating Could be I mean, you know, agent based modeling. You could do it with that stuff. So, you know, our our group has used agent based modeling to do something like the Fermi Paradox that was that was agent based modeling. But you can also do this. People at Santa Fe have done this. Other groups have done this. To use agent based modeling to track the the or formation of hierarchies, the formation of stable hierarchies, the so I think that I think it's actually very doable, but understanding the kind of assumptions and principles that are going into it and what you can extract from those. That is what is sort of the frontier. Do you think if humans colonize Mars, the dynamic between the civilization on Earth and Mars will be fundamentally different than the dynamic between individual nations on Earth right now. Like, that that's a thing to load into the simulated the agent based simulation we're talking about. If we settle it, Mars will very quickly wanna become its own nation. Well, no. There's already gonna be nations on Mars. That's guaranteed. Yeah. The moment you have one million people. One the moment you have one million people, there's gonna be two tribes. Right. And then they're going to start fighting. Right. And the question is interplanetary fighting. How quickly does that happen? And does it have a different nature to it based on the distances, you know? Are you a fan of the expanse? Do you have you watched the expanse? Great show. Because it's all about that. I highly recommend to everybody. It's based on series of books that are excellent. It's on prime. Six seasons. And it's basically about the settled solar system. It takes place about three hundred years from now, and the entire solar system is settled. And it is the best show about interplanetary politics. The first season actually, the journal was it foreign foreign affairs? Said the best show on TV about politics. It takes place. It's interplanetary. So, yeah, I think, you know, human beings being human beings. Yes. Well, there will be warfare and there will be conflict. I mean, I don't think it'll be necessarily all that different. You know, because really, I think within a few hundred years, we will have lots of people in the solar system. And it doesn't even have to be on Mars. We did a paper where we looked based on because I was wanting to know about whether an idea in the expanse was really possible in the expanse, the the asteroid belt. What they've done is they have colonized the asteroid belt by hollowing out the asteroids and spinning them up and living on the on the inside. Right? Because they have the coriolis force. And I thought like, wow, what a cool idea? And when I ran the blog for NPR actually talked to the guys and said, did you guys calculate this, see whether it's possible. Sadly, it's not possible. The rock is just not strong enough that if you try to spin it up to the speeds, you need to get one third gravity, which is what I think the minimum you need. For human beings. The rock would just fall apart, it would break. But we came up with another idea, which was that if you could take small asteroids, put a giant bag around them, a nanofiber bag, and spin those up, it would inflate the bag, and then even a small couple of kilometer wide asteroid would spanned out to, you could get, like, Manhattan's worth of material insight. So forget about even colonizing Mars, space stations, right, or space habitats with millions of people in them. So anyway, the point is that I think, you know, within a few hundred years, it is not unimaginable that there will be millions, if not billions of people living in the solar system. And you think most of them will be in space habitats versus on Mars and on the planetary surface. You know, it's a lot easier on some on some level. Right? It depends on how, like, with nanofabrication and such. But, you know, getting down to gravity well is hard. Right? So, you know, there's a certain way in which there's a lot of you know, it's a lot easier to build real estate out of the asteroids. But we'll probably do both. I mean, I think what'll happen is, oh, you know, the next should we make it through climate change and nuclear war and all the other end AI? The the next thousand years of human history is the solar system. Right? And so, you know, I think we'll settle every nook and cranny, we possibly can. And it's, you know, it's a beautiful What I love about what's hopeful about it is this idea you're gonna have all of these pockets. And, you know, I'm sure there's gonna be a Mormon space with that. Like, you know, there's gonna be whatever you want, a libertarian space habitat. Everybody's gonna be able to kinda create there there'll be lots of experiments in human flourishing. Mhmm. And those kinds of experiments will be really useful for us to sort of figure out better ways for us to interact and have maximum flourishing, maximum wellness, maximum democracy, maximum freedom. Do you think that's a good backup solution to go out into space, so to avoid the possibility of humans destroying themselves completely here on earth? Well, I think, you know, I wanna be always careful with that because it like I said, it's centuries that we're talking about. Yes. Right? So, you know, the the problem with climate change and the same with nuclear war is breathing down our necks now. So it's not a, you know, trying to establish a a a base on Mars is gonna be so hard that it is not even gonna be close to being self sufficient for a couple of, you know, a century at least. So it's not like a backup plan now. You know, we have to solve the problem of climate change. We have to deal with that. There's still enough nuclear weapons to really do our, you know, horrific things to the planet for human beings. So I don't think it's like a backup plan in that way, but I do think, like I said, it's the prize. It's you know, if we get through this, then we get the entire solar system to sort of play around it and and experiment with and do really cool things with. Well, I think it could be a lot less than a couple of centuries if there's a urgency. Like a real urgency, like a catastrophe, like a maybe a small nuclear war breaks out where it's like holy shit. This is for sure for sure a bigger one is looming. Yeah. Maybe maybe if geopolitical, the war between China and the United States escalates. Well, there's this tension that builds and builds and builds and it becomes more obvious that we need to really, really, really, really realize. Really? I think my my only dilemma with that is that I just think that a a a self sufficient base is a so far away that, like, say, you start doing that. And then there is a full scale nuclear exchange. That base is, you know, that's not gonna last because it's just, you know, the the self sufficiency requires a kind of economy, like, literally a material economy that we are so far from with Mars that we are centuries from. Like I said, you know, three centuries, which is not that long. Two to three centuries, you know, look at eighteen twenty. Nobody had traveled faster than sixty miles an hour unless they were falling off a cliff. Right. And now we routinely travel at five hundred miles an hour, but it is sort of centuries long. So that's why I think I think we'd be better off trying to solve these problems than, you know, I just think the odds that we're gonna be able to create a self sufficient colony on Mars before that threat comes to head is small. So we'd have to deal with the threat. Yeah. It's an interesting scientific and engineering question of how to create self sufficient colony on Mars or out in spaces in space habitat. Like where earth entirely could be destroyed, you could still survive. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's really what about, you know, thinking about complex systems. Right? A space habitat, you know, would have to be as robust. As an ecosystem, as the kind of thing, you know, you only see a pond with all the different webs of interactions. You know, that's why I always think that, you know, if this process of going out in the space is actually will help us with climate change, and with thinking about making a long term sustainable version of human civilization. Because you really have to think about these webs, the the the complexity of these webs, and recognize the biosphere has been doing this forever. The biosphere knows how to do this. Right? And so a, how do we support how do we build a vibrant powerful technosphere? That also doesn't, you know, mess with the biospheres, mess with the biosphere's capacity to support our technosphere. So, you know, by doing this by trying to build space habitats in some sense, you're thinking about building a small scale version of this. So I think it's I think the two problems are gonna kinda feedback on each other. Well, there's also the other possibility of like the movie Darren Ornovsky's postcard from Earth where we can create this kind of life gun that just shoots as as opposed to engineering everything Yeah. Basically seeding life on a bunch of places and letting life do its thing, which is really good at doing. It seems like so as opposed to, like, with the space habit that you basically have to build the entire biosphere and the atmosphere, the whole the whole thing, the whole thing. Yeah. You know, if you just hey, the aforementioned cockroach with some bacteria, place it in Europa. I think you'd be surprised what happens. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Like, honestly, if you put a huge amount of bacteria, like, a giant number of organisms from Earth into on Mars, on some of these moons of the other planets in the solar system. Do you think, like, I I feel like some of them would actually find a way to survive? You know, the moon is hard because the moon is just like there's no I know. The moon may be really hard. But, you know, that'd be I mean, I wonder somebody must have done these experiments. Right? Like how because we know there are extreme files. Right? We know that they're you can go down, you know, ten miles below the earth surface and there are things where there's no sunlight you know, the conditions are so extreme, and there's lots of microbes having a great time living off the radioactivity, you know, in the rocks. But, you know, they had lots of time to evolve to those conditions. So I'm not sure if you dumped a bunch of bacteria. You know, so somebody, like, that somebody must have done these experiments. Like, you know, how fast could microbial evolution occur in under harsh conditions that you maybe get somebody who figures out? Okay, I can do this. I think the moon's too much because it's so sterile. But, you know, Mars I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. We have to that but it's an interesting idea. I wonder if somebody has done those experiments. Yeah. If you think somebody would, like, let's take a bunch of microbes. The harsh the take the harshest possible condition of all different kinds. Right. Pressure, all this kind of stuff. Right. Pressure, salinity, and then just, like, dump a bunch of things that are not used to it. And then just see, does everybody just die? You know, that's it. There's, you know The thing about life. It it flourishes in a non sterile environment where there's a bunch of options for resources even if the condition is super harsh. In the lab, I don't know if you can reconstruct harsh conditions plus options for survival. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, you have to have the the the the huge variety of resources that are always available on a planet somehow even when it's a super harsh condition. So that so that's actually not a trillion experiment. And I wouldn't even if somebody did that experiment in the lab, I'd be a little bit skeptical. Because like if because I could see bacteria doesn't survive in this kinds of temperature. But then I'm building, I don't know. I don't know. Is there enough. Right? Is it you know, is there are there other options? Like, you know, is the condition rich enough? Rich enough. Yeah. You know, there's there's an alternative view, though, which is there's this great book by Kim Stanley Robinson called Aurora. Yeah. So there's been a million Century ship stories, like where, you know, earth sends out a, you know, generation ship or century ship and it goes to another planet and they land and they colonize. And on this one, they get all the way there, and they think it's the planet's gonna be habitable. And it turns out that it's not habitable for earth life, like that. The others that there is like bacteria or pryons, actually, you know, super that just, like, you know, kill people in this simplest way. And the is the important thing about this book was the idea that, like, you know, life is actually very tied to its planet. It may not be so easy. I just thought it was a really interesting idea. I'm not necessarily supporting it, but that actually life reflects the planetary conditions. They're not the planetary, the planet itself, the whole lineage, the whole history of the biosphere, and it may not be so easy just to just sort of be like, oh, just drop it over here and it'll, you know, because the bacteria, even though they're individual examples of life. And I kind of believe this, the true unit of life. It's not DNA, it's not a cell, it's the biosphere, it's the whole The whole community. Yeah. That's actually an interesting field of study. It's how when you arrive from one planet to another, so we humans arrive to a planet that has a biosphere, maybe a technosphere. What is the way to integrate Yeah. Without killing yourself or or the other one or the other one. That's let's just stick to biology. Like, that that's an interesting question. I don't know if we have a rigorous way of investigating that. Because everybody everything on life is, you know, has the same lineage. We all come from Luca, you know, the last universal common answer string. What you see is often in science fiction, people will do things like, oh, well, it's okay because like that bio that metabolism, that biochemistry. So different from ours, that we can coexist because they don't even know each other. You know? Right? That the you know. And then the other version is you get there, you land, and instantly, you know, the nosebleeds, and you're dead. So let's Unfortunately, I think it's the latter. Yeah. It sort of feels like it's still a very alien kind of thing. So as we look out there according to the Drake equations, we just discussed, seems impossible to me that there's not civilizations everywhere. So how do we look at them? This process of setting. I have to put on my scientist hat and just say, my gut feeling is that dumb life, so to speak, is common. I am a little agnostic about I I can see ways in which intelligent civilizations may be sparse. Yeah. But but until, you know, we gotta go look. It's all it's all armchair. Armchair is strong. That's that's from our sort of rigorous scientific perspective. From my bro side perspective, it seems, again, smoking this the aforementioned weed. It's After the fog here. It's I mean, honestly It's it's really just Yeah. It was impossible to me that there's not potentially dead, but advanced civilizations everywhere in our galaxy. Yeah. Yeah. The potentially dead part, I think. Right. It could be that, like, making civilizations is easy. They just don't last long. So what we when we went out there, we'd find a lot of extinct civilizations. Extinct civilizations. Yeah. Apex predators don't survive. Like, they they get get better, better, better, better, and that Right. Die. Kill themselves. Awesome. Anyway, so just how do we find them? Yeah. So SETI, search for extraterrestrial technology, is a term that I am not fond of using anymore. I mean, some people in my field are, so I'm sorry. Folks. But I'm really what I really like is the idea of techno signatures because I think, you know, clearly, to me, SETI is the first of all, intelligence. We're not really looking for intelligence. We're looking for technology. I mean, you know, And SETI, the classic idea SETI is the radio telescopes, you know, in contact, Jody Foster with the headphones. That whole thing is still part. It's still active. There's still great things going on with it, but suddenly this whole new window opened up. When we discovered exoplanets, we now found a new way to look for intelligent civilizations or life in general in a way that doesn't have any of the assumptions that had to go into the classic radio study. And specifically what I mean is we're not looking for somebody sending us a beacon. You really needed that with the classic model. For a bunch of different reasons, you had to assume they wanted to be found and they were sending you a super powerful beacon. Now because we know exactly where to look and we know exactly how to look we can just go about looking for passive signatures of the civilization, going about its civilization in business, you know, without asking whether they want to be contacted or not. So this is what we call a biosignature or a techno signature. It is an imprint in the light from the planet of the activity of a biosphere or a technosphere. And that's really important. You know, that that that is why kind of the whole Gaia idea ends up being astrobiological that biospheres and technospheres are so potent they change the entire planet, and you can see that from twenty light years. So let's give an example of a biosignature to start off with, which would be a signature of a biospere, oxygen. Right? In our on earth, at least, we know that oxygen is only in the atmosphere because life put it there. If life went away, the oxygen and particularly the oxygen and methane, that pair, they would disappear, you know, very quickly. They'd react away. They'd all be gone. So if you find a planet with oxygen and methane, that's a good bet that there's a biosphere there. Okay. What about technospheres? Technospheres, this is what you know, so I'm the principal investigator on the first grant NASA has ever given to do these kind of exoplanet techno signatures. NASA was kind of for reasons we can talk about NASA had gotten pretty gun shy about funding anything about intelligent life. But okay, what's an example of a techno signature? Well, one could be atmospheric pollution. I'm gonna put pollution in quotes here because it doesn't have to be pollution. But gases like chlorofluorocarbons. So we've dumped, you know, we dumped a huge amount of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere by mistake. It was affecting the ozone. We put so much in there that actually we this is one of the things we did. We did a paper where we showed, you could detect it across interstellar distances. You could look at the atmosphere. Look at the light coming from a distant planet. Pass the light through a spectrograph and see the the spectral lines, the fingerprint, the spectral fingerprint of chlorofluorocarbons in an atmosphere. And that would for sure tell you that there was a technological civilization there because there's no other way to make chlorofluorocarbons except through some kind of industrial process. So you're looking for in the case of the biosphere, you're looking for anomalies in the spectrograph. I wouldn't necessarily call these anomalies. I'm looking for things that for biosignature. I'm looking for things that a geosphere. Right? The other that just rock and air wouldn't produce on itself. What kind of chemicals would life produce? Right. And that's that's part of the that's the interesting thing. Right? So that's what you know, so we can use Earth as an example. Right? We can say, look, oxygen. We know there would be no oxygen. The atmosphere wasn't for dimethanol sulfide, which is a compound that phylo plankton dump into the atmosphere a lot of it. That's sometimes mentioned. And there was even there was a paper that somebody wrote where it was like, well, we're not saying we see it, but, you know, there's a bunch of noise in the spectrum right there. So, you know, there's a whole list of things that earth has done that are in the atmosphere that might be biosignatures. But now we're reaching an interesting point. The field has matured to the point where we can start asking about agnostic. Biosignatures, things that have nothing to do with earth's history. But we think that that would still be indications of this weirdness we call life. Right? What what is it in general that life does, that leaves an imprint. So one of these things could be the structure of the network of chemical reactions. That biology always produces very different chemical networks who's reacting with who than just rock and water. Right? So so there's been some proposals for network, you know, biosignatures. Information theory, you can use, you can try and look at the information that is in the different compounds. That or you find in the atmosphere. And maybe that information shows you like, oh, there's too much information here. There there must have been biology happening. It's not just rock. Same thing for techno. We're that's what we're working on right now. That for techno signatures as well. So how do you detect? Techno signatures. Okay. So with techno signatures, I gave the example of chlorofluorocarbons. So that would be an example of. And again, that one is a non agnostic one because we sort of like, oh, we produced chlorofluorocarbons. Maybe they will. Right? And there's solar panels. Right? You can actually, the glint off of solar panels will produce a the way the light is reflected off of solar panels, whether no matter what it's made out of, actually. There was a paper that Monazvi lingam, Monazvi Loeb did in I think was twenty seventeen, we've just followed up on it. That actually could act as a techno signature. You'd be able to see in the reflected light, this sort of big jump that would occur because of city lights. City of artificial illumination, if there if there's really, like, you know, large scale cities, like, you know, Coruscant and Star Wars or Tranor in the foundation, those city lights would be detectable, you know, the spectral imprint of those across. Twenty, thirty light years. So, you know, our job in this grant is to develop the first ever library of techno signatures. Nobody's really ever thought about this before. So we're trying to come up with all the possible ideas for what a civilization might produce that could be visible across, you know, interstellar distances. And are these good ones? Or is these ones gonna be hard to detect or such? City lights. So if a planet is all lit up, with artificial light across twenty, thirty light years, we can see it. Yeah. If you looked at Earth at night from a distance where, you know, looked at the spectra, and you had sensitive enough instruments, you'd be able to see all the sodium lights. And the reflected light off of, you know, they they bounce off the ground. Right? The the light bounces off the ground. So you'd convolve the the sodium lamps with the reflected specter from the ground. And yeah, you'd be able to see that they're city lights. Now, increase that by a factor of a thousand you know, if you had a a a a a tran tour and you'd be able to detect that across interstellar instances. Thomas Beatty did this work, who's now working with us. What do you think is the most detectable thing about Earth? Wow. We just this is a fun. We just have a Sofia chief. You can assume it's part of our collaboration. Just did a paper. We did Earth from Earth. If you were looking at Earth with Earth technology for a bunch of different techno signatures, how close would you have to be to be able to detect them? And most of them turn out to be you'd have to be pretty close, at least out to the old cloud. But actually, it's it is our radio signatures still. That is still most detectable. By the way, when you said you had to be pretty close and then you said the old cloud, that's not very close. But you mean, like, from an intercellular Is your stellar just real quick, you know, we we really wanna know is like, I'm sitting here on Earth. I'm looking at these exoplanets. The nearest star is four light years away. So that's like the minimum distance. So what can if I'm looking at exoplanets, what kind of signals could I see? What is detectable about earth with our current technology from the a nearest solar system. Oh my god. There's all kinds of stuff. Well, like our our the the the plural fluorocarbon. You can see, you can see Earth's pollution. And, you know, I think city lights you had to be within you know, within the solar system. If they do direct imaging of Earth, they're gonna need much more powerful. Yeah. But let me tell you what they're let's let's talk about direct imaging for a moment because I just have to go on. This is such a cool idea. Right? So what we really want and the next generation of space telescopes and such as we're trying to do direct imaging. We're trying to get, you know, an image of a planet separated from its star to be able to see the reflected light or the actual emission from the planet itself. Yeah. By the way, just clarify direct imaging means literally like a picture. A picture. But the problem is is that with the even with the the the pic that's gonna come after j w s t, it's gonna be a pixel. Right? You're not gonna get any kind of resolution. You'll be able to get the light from it, which you'll be able to pass through a spectrograph, but you're not gonna be able to take picture. But there is this idea called the solar gravity lens telescope. I think that's what it is. And the idea is insane. Right? So their general relativity says, look, massive bodies distort space. They actually curve spacetime. So the sun is a massive body. And so that means that the light passing through the sun gets focused like a lens. Right? So the idea is to send a bunch of telescopes out kinda into the Oort cloud and then look back towards the sun towards an exoplanet that is behind not directly behind the sun, but is, you know, in the direction of the sun. And then let the let the sun act like a lens and collect, focus the light Mhmm. Onto the telescope. And you would be able to get. And they've done it's amazing. Like, they've already this idea is insane. They'd be able to get if everything works out twenty four kilometer resolution. You'd be able to see Manhattan on an Excel planet. And this thing and it sounds insane. But actually, you know, NASA they've already got the team has already gotten through, like, sort of, three levels of NASA, you know, there's there's the NASA program for, like, give us your wackiest idea. Right? And then the ones that survive that are, like, okay, tell us whether that wacky idea, you know, is even feasible. And then and they're marching along. And the idea is that, like, you know, they even have plans for how you'd be able to get these probes out into the Ork cloud on relatively fast timescales. You need to be about five hundred times as far from the sun as earth is. But right now, everything looks like the idea seems to hold together. So probably when I'll be dead, but when you're an old man, it's possible that something like this. Could you imagine having, like, Yeah. Res that kind of resolution. A picture of an exoplanet down to, you know, kilometers. So I'm very excited about that. I can only imagine having a picture like that, and then there's some mysterious artifacts that you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's both inspiring and and almost heartbreaking that we can see, like, I think we we'll be able to see a civilization where there's, like, a lot of scientists agree that this is very likely of something, and then we can't. We can't get there. But, you know, I mean, again, this is the thing about being long lived. We've gotta get to the point where we're long lived enough that so let's say we found, like, this is why we just like that. Let's imagine that we find say, ten light years away, we find a planet that looks like it's got technoconductors. Right? It doesn't end there. Like, that would be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. And it wouldn't be like, well, okay, we're done. The first thing we do is we big bigger telescope to try and do those imaging. Right? And then the next thing after that, we plan a mission there. Right? There's there we would figure out, like, with breakthrough breakthrough starshot. There was this idea of trying to use, you know, giant lasers to propel small spacecraft light sails, almost to the speed of light. So they would get there in ten years and take pictures. And so, well, you know, if we actually made this discovery, there would be the impulse. There would be the effort to actually try and send something to to get there. Now, you know, we probably couldn't land. We could But the you know, so maybe we maybe we'd take thirty years to build, ten years to get there, ten years to get the picture back. Okay. You're dead, but your kids are you know what I mean? So it becomes now this multigenerational project long did it take to build the pyramids? How long did it take to build the giant cathedrals? Right? Those were multigenerational projects. And I think we're on the cusp of that kind of project. I think that would probably unite humans I think it would play a big role. I think it would be helpful. I mean, human beings are a mess. Let's face it. But I think having that that's why I always say to people discovery of life of any kind of life, even if it was microbial life, it wouldn't matter that to know that we're not an accident. To know that there is probably if we found one example of life, we'd know that we're not an accident and there's probably lots of life and that we're a community. We're part of a a cosmic kind of community of life and who knows what life has done. Right? We don't really all bets are off with life. Since we're talking about the future of telescopes. Let's talk about our current super sexy awesome telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope that I still can't believe it actually worked. I can't believe it worked. I was really skeptical. I was like, okay, guys. Alright. Sure. We only got one shot for this incredibly complicated piece of hardware to unfold. So what kind of stuff can we see with it? I I I've been just looking through different kinds of announcements that have been detected. There's been some direct imaging Yes. Like a single pixel. The kinds of exoplaners were able to direct image, I guess, would have to be hot. Hot. Usually far away from the, you know, reasonably far away from the star. I think j w s t is really kinda at the hairy edge of being able to do much with this. What's more important, I think, for j w s t, is the spectra. And the problem with spectra is that there's not sexy pictures. It's like, hey, look at this wiggly line, but be able to find and characterize atmospheres around terrestrial exoplanets. Is the critical next step. That's where we are right now. In order to look for life, we're gonna be We need to find planets with atmospheres. Right? And then we need to be able to do this thing called characterization where we look at the spectral fingerprints for what's in the atmosphere. Is there carbon? Is there carbon dioxide? Is there oxygen? And is their methane. And that's the most exciting thing. For example, there was this planet K two eighteen b, which had they did a beautiful job getting the spectra. And the spectra indicated it may be an entirely new kind of habitable world called a Hisian world. HiSean meaning hydrogen ocean world. And that is a kind of planet that it would be a, you know, kinda in the super earth sub Neptune domain we were talking about. You know, maybe eight times that mass of the earth. But it's got a layer of hydrogen of an atmosphere of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an amazing greenhouse gas. So hydrogen will keep the the planet underneath it warm enough that you could get liquid water. You can get a giant ocean of of liquid water. And that's an entirely different kind of planet that could be habitable planet. You know, they could be a sixty degree warm ocean. So the data that came out of JWST for that planet was good enough to be able to indicate, like, oh, yeah. You know what? The models from what we understand about the models, this looks like it's a it could be a I see in world. And it's a hundred and twenty light years away from Earth. Yeah. And so isn't that amazing you can a hundred and twenty light years away, but we can see into the atmosphere. We can see into the atmosphere so well that we can be like, oh, look, methane methane was a five sigma detection. Like, you knew that the data were so good that it was like the gold standard of science. What about detecting maybe through direct imaging or, in other ways, megastructures that the the civilizations build? You know what's great about megastructures is, first of all, it's fun to say. Who doesn't wanna say megastructure? Alien megastructure. Right? Morning. I'm looking for an opportunity to say that. So the the the the her example of this is the Dyson Sphere. Right? Which is amazing because, you know, it was literally nineteen sixty that this idea came up. Can't explain the Dyson? Yeah. The Dyson Sphere. So Freeman Dyson, you know, one of the greatest physicists ever who had was very broad minded and thought about a lot of different things. He recognized that, you know, when his civilization as civilizations progress, what they're gonna need is ever more energy to do ever more, you know, amazing things. And what's the best energy source in a solar system? It's the star. Right? So if you surrounded the star with solar collecting machines, sunlight collecting machines, and the the limit of this would actually build a sphere. An actual sphere around your star that had all solar panels on the inside, you could capture every photon. The star produced, which is, you know, this insane amount of light you would have enough power now to do anything to reengineer your solar system. So that was a Dyson sphere. Turns out that a Dyson sphere doesn't really work because it's unstable, you know. But a Dyson swarm is and that's really what he meant. You know, this large collection of large orbiting structures that we're able to collect light. Yeah. So he didn't actually mean a rigid right, sphere structure Yeah. He basically meant a swarm. So Yeah. That that, like you said, and then the limit basically starts to look People started to say, yeah, it was like a sphere. And we actually almost thought we might have found one of these Back with Bordeon star, we saw you know, the way we detect planets is through the transit method where the planet passes in front of the star, and there's a dip in the starlight. It's a little eclipse basically. And we know exactly what they should look like. And then with this one star, there were these really weird transits where like it was like this little dragon's tooth. And then there'd be another one and another one and another one and then nothing and then three more. And in the paper that was written, about this. They suggested that, you know, they went through the list of they all just could be comments, could be trunks of a broken up planet, and it could also be an alien megastructure. And, of course, the news picked up on this and, like, everybody's, you know, news feed the next day, alien megastructure is discovered. Turns out, sadly, They were not alien megastructures. They were probably like gas or dust clouds. But it raised the possibility like, oh, these are observable and people have worked out the details of what they would look like. You don't really need direct imaging. You can do trans Right? They're big enough that when they pass in front of the star, they're gonna produce a little blip of light because that's what they're supposed to. Right? They're absorbing starlight. So people did have worked out, like, well, a square one or a triangular one. But that wouldn't be a disness sphere. That would be like one object. One object. Right? Which is what you if it's a swarm, you'd expect, like, the light to be, like, blinking in and out as these things pass in front of. You know, if you've got thousands of these, much of the time they'll be blotting out the star. Sometimes they won't be. Right? And so you're gonna get an irregular sort of signal transit signal. Yeah. One you wouldn't expect from a star that doesn't have anything. Exactly. Or just a planet. Right? Or a couple of planets. There'd be so many of these that it would be, like, beep beep blip blip blip blip. And that usually doesn't happen in a in a star system because there's only just a handful of planets. That's exactly what it is. Everything's coagulated. And in a stable solar system, you get a handful of planets, you know, five, ten, that that's it, probably. And nothing else. So if now suddenly you see lots of these little micro transits, you're telling me there's something else that's big enough to create a transit, but, you know, too many of them. And also within a regular shape, the transit itself, that these are these could be mega structures. How many people are looking for megastructures now? Well, the main groups looking for megastructures are, again, Jason Wright at Penn State and collaborators. The way they're looking for it though is for infrared light. Because you know, the second law of thermodynamics says, look, if you capture all of this starlight, you're gonna warm up the you know, your thing's gonna warm up and emit an infrared. You're just gonna be waste heat, waste heat, and waste light Mhmm. From this. It feels like a louder clear way to detect it. Right. And that's actually, you know, Dyson, that's actually why Dyson proposed it. He wasn't really proposing it because, like, he was saying, this is what civilizations are gonna do. He proposed it because he was, like, oh, we wanna start looking for alien civilizations. Here's something that would have a detectable signature. So Jason and company have done, you know, pretty good searches. And recently, they they made news because, you know, they were able to eliminate a lot of places. No. These are not Jason Sears, but they did have a couple that were, like, anomalous enough that they're, like, well, kind of what it would look like. It's not a detection. And they were saying they wouldn't ever say it's a detection, but they were like they were not non detections. And they're potential candidates. And they're potential candidates. Yeah. Love it. We have megastructure candidates. That's inspiring. What other megastructures do you think that could be? Mean that so that's that's the fears about capturing the energy of a star. Yeah. Or there could be other Well, there's something called the Clark Belt. Right? So we have a bunch of satellites that are in geosynchronous orbit. Nothing naturally is gonna end up in geosink absorbent. Right? Dosing absorbers is one particular orbit that's really useful if you wanna beam things straight down or if you wanna put a space elevator up. Right? Mhmm. So there's this idea that if, you know, a civilization becomes you know, advanced enough that it's really using geosynchronous orbit that you actually get a belt, something that would actually be detectable from a distance via a transit. There's been a couple of papers written about the possibility. Of these clark belts, densely occupied clark belts being a mega structure. It's not as mega as a dyson swarm, but it's, you know, kind of planetary scale. You think it's detectable clark belt? It could be I mean, like, in our list of techno signatories, it would be down there. But it would be, again, if you had an advanced enough civilization that did enough of this, it would certainly you'd you'd have a clark belt, and the question is whether or not it's detectable. Yeah. Probably, Dyson sphere is the that's the more exciting I think I'll do one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of the the Dyson Sphere, let's talk to the Kardashev scales. Right. What is the Kardashev scale and where are humans on it? Right. So the Kardashev scale was at the same time, this is this golden age of SETI, like kind of like sixty fifty nine to sixty five when it just starts. Like, this is, you know, Frank Drake has done his first experiment. People are like, oh my god, this is even possible. And so people are just thrown out of these ideas. And as I, you know, said in the book, science is conservative. And what I mean by that is it holds on to its best ideas. So, ardship comes up with this idea that, look, if we're again, it's always about detectability. If we're looking for civilizations, we should think about what are the state what are the natural stages, natural in quotes, that a civilization goes through. And he was thinking in terms of energy use, which is like a good physicist. So the he said, look, the first hurdle in terms of energy or or threshold about civilization will go through is using all the starlight that falls onto a planet. You call that a type one civilization. In whatever way you're doing it, some large fraction of the starlight that falls on your planet you're using for your own ends. The next would be to use all the starlight. There is from that star. Right? So that's the Dyson sphere. So he actually dyson had already proposed his idea of the swarm and Kardashev was picking up. So that's a type two civilization. Type three is galactic scale, a civilization that could use all the starlight in a galaxy see. Right? So we are now where are we now? Remarkably, on a log scale. We're at point seven of a type one. So we're not even type one. No. No. No. We're not even type one. But according to there was a paper written by a group That said, you know, if we continue on our path, we'll be at a type one at around twenty three hundred. Twenty three hundred. Yeah. So this is on a log scale. Yeah. So point seven. So type one is about ten to the sixteenth watts. Type two is ten orders of magnitude larger than that ten to the twenty six watts. And I think estimate for the galaxy is another ten orders of magnitude. Yeah. Because there's a hundred billion star off order, a hundred billion stars. So that's a lot. That's a lot. Do do you think humans ever get to type one? I think, you know, that there's a problem with type one, which is that, you know, we already know about climate change. Right? The effects of our harvesting energy to do the work of civilization is already changing the climate state. Right? And that's something that, you know, Carter Sheff couldn't have recognized. When you, you know, there's there's the first law of thermodynamics, right, which is just about energy, you know, the different forms of energy, then there's the second law, which is about when you use that energy. And Cardiatorship wasn't thinking about the second law. If you get all that energy and you use it, There's waste heat. You don't get to use it all. Right? You can only Second law tells you that if, you know, I have a tank of gasoline, I can only use a certain fraction of the energy in that tank, and the rest is gonna go to heating up the engine block. So that second law tells you that, you know, you can only use so much energy before the climate state is like, uh-oh, you know, sorry, is gonna change on you. So there's a way in which we probably can't get to a type one. Without, like, devastating the Earth's climate. So we're probably gonna have to figure out the most important thing actually here is probably this is why space becomes sort of the colonization or settlement of space. If we have an idea that we've been working on for a while called service worlds, right, that at some point, you probably move a lot of your industry off world. Right? We've got mercury for example. There's nothing on mercury. There's no life on mercury. Why don't you put your energy harvesting there? Right? Because, you know, you you can't mess with the biosphere. The biosphere is more powerful than you are. Right? And so yeah. So you so there's limits to how much energy we can harvest to do work on the earth without really adversely affecting the biosphere. It does seem that the best response to the climate change is not to use less technology, but to invent better technology, and to invent technology that avoids the destructive effects. This is the frontier where you are and that was the topic of my last book, light of the stars. It's like you've got you have to do the astrobiology of the anthropocene. You have to see the transition that we're going through now of the anthropocene. On a kind of planetary astrobiological framework. And, you know, that paper we were talking about with a ten billion trillion world. That was actually in service of the work I was doing for this other book where I wanted to know how often are do you go through an answer? How you know, does every civilization that technological civilization trigger its own planetary crisis, its own climate, anthropocene crisis. And the answer we actually came up from doing models was like, yeah, probably. Mhmm. And then the question is, are you smart enough to figure out how to readjust what you're doing technologically? So that you're not, you know, that all boats rise. Right? You wanna figure out how to do this so that the biosphere becomes even more productive and healthy and resilient. So yeah, right, it's the kind of technology. I think there's probably absolutely limits on how much energy you can use. Use, but how do you use that energy? And then also, yeah, getting off planet eventually. If you wanna use ten times more energy than that, you're gonna be not gonna do it on on world. So how do we detect alien type one two and three civilizations. So we've been kind of talking about basically type one civilization detection. Yeah. Right? Maybe will the diasympthen theory start to get, like, a little bit more type two? But I it feels like if you have a type two civilization, it won't be just the Dyson sphere. Right. It feels like that just for the same reason you mentioned, climate change, but now at the star system level, they're probably expanding. Right. So how how would you detect a type two? How about propulsion plumes. Right? If you're standing No. No. We've got this. We just I literally put in a NASA proposal now. Thomas Beatty, who's joined us from these at the University of Wisconsin. Has an idea to look for plumes. Right? If you have a a a solar system wide civilization. Right? And you got space truckers going back and forth. Right? You know, from Mars to, you know, they're doing the insettleness run. They're accelerating and decelerating the whole way there. Right? If you wanna get to Mars in a couple weeks, you have your fusion drive on the entire way out there. You flip and burn and have it on you know, so you're all you're also always have gravity. You have thrust gravity. So would those plumes be detectable? Because now you've got spaceships going all over the place and the odds that, like, you know, the plume is gonna cross your field, the view becomes could become pretty high. So, yeah, that's I think that's a good way of looking for. That's one idea. Of looking for, you know, large scale interplanetary, which is kind of like when you're getting to a type type two. Another possibility is looking for the tailings of asteroid mining. This was an idea. It was a group at Harvard Smithsonian. That, you know, to be able to look for if you're really chewing up asteroids to build space habitats. Can, you know, there'd be dust particles left around and would they look different from just say the dust, you know, from just regular collisions? So pollution of all different kinds. Pollution of all different kinds. And trash also. Okay. So trash is an interesting idea when you come to the actual solar system. Right? We are actually There's a whole other field of techno signatures which are things in the solar system. What if somebody came by? A billion years ago, you know, and left some stuff. Right? So the earth has been showing biosignatures for billions of years. And, you know, a species like us looking at our level, looking at earth would have been able to know that earth had life on it, had a biosign had a biosphere, for billions of years. So maybe somebody sent something by, you know, of a half a billion years ago. So this idea of looking, say, at the moon for artifacts is that have been there for a long time. It's something that people a number of people are doing. We're just working on a paper where we just calculated this was super fun. We calculated how long would the lunar lander exist on the moon before micro meteorites just chewed it down. Right? How long would you be able to land on the moon go, oh, look, there's, you know, there's somebody was here and left some debris. So there's this process called gardening, which is just a micro meteorite, constant range of micro meteorites. You know, and that's what where you get the lunar regolith that fine powder on the moon is because of this gardening. And it turns out it is literally hundreds of millions to billions of years. Oh, nice. That the yeah. That the lunar lander will be visible. Oh, so we should be able to find artifacts. Yeah. If there's art if there artifacts on and people have proposed doing this with artificial intelligence. We have you know, the moon has been mapped down to, like, a couple of meters with various probes. And all that data is sitting there. So have why not use machine learning to, like, look through all those things and look for anything that looks not like the lunar surface. And they did a test program where they gave it. They gave the computer, you know, sort of, like, I don't know, fifty miles around the Apollo eleven or Apollo maybe was Apollo seventeen site. And it instantly was able to pull out the lander. I mean, the whole task of looking for anomaly is something that looks not like the lunar surface. You mean it sound obvious, but it's not exactly obvious. Like, an anomaly is is really not I mean, detect something that doesn't look right about the surface. Yeah. It's it's actually really difficult. Really difficult. It's really difficult. And it's you know what's cool? It's a really information theoretic kind of proposal. You really have to use information theory to say, like, what's the background? What's you know, how do I define something that I can say that looks weird? So, yeah, maybe when you look in at a spectrograph or something, like, it's still it's still like it's gonna look really weird potentially. Like, we're kind of we're kind of hypothesizing all the things that humans would build. Right. And how do we detect that? Right. But that could be really weird stuff. That's why there's this emphasis now on these agnostic signatures. Right? So actually, disequilibrium is a nice one. One way to define life is it is a system that is far from equilibrium. Right? It's alive. Right? Mhmm. Because as soon as it dies, it turns into goes back to equilibrium. And so you can look at all chemicals in an atmosphere, even if you don't know whether these could be chemicals that you have no idea whether or not they have anything to do with life. But the degree of disequilibrium, the degree to which they show that that atmosphere has not, you know, the chemicals have not all kind of like just gone down to a you know, they've all reacted away to an equilibrium state. You can actually tell that in very general ways using what's called a gives gives free energy. And that that's kind of a signature. Like, if you see an atmosphere that is wildly out of equilibrium, you know, that indicates that there's some there's something happening on that planet, biosphere or technosphere that is pumping gases you know, into the into the atmosphere that is keeping the whole system from relaxing. So is it possible we can detect anomalies in in space time? Well, you you could detect, and there's there's been some work on this, like with the Accu Bray drive, you know, these proposals for warp drives. And we could talk about that later, a bump skeptical of those, but because it may really be possible. You just can't go fast on the speed of light. But people have done work on, like, you know, what would be the signature of on a cupri drive. What would be the signature? Like, you know, could you detect if you're using a drive like that, then you certainly are distorting space time, which means any light that's passing by has gotten, you know, the it's it's it's trajectory has gotten altered because it had to pass through the distorted space time. So, yeah, there are possibilities along with that. You know, one of the funny things I don't know if they've gotten past this, but somebody calculated the problem with the Accuperate drive or this warp drive. Was that if if you dropped out of warp, there would be this spray of gamma rays that would like sterilize any planet in front of you. Mhmm. So it's like, well, yeah, you probably don't wanna do that, but that would be a great biopsies, our techno signature. Another planet obliterated. So you think it's not possible to travel fast than speak a little bit? I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that. But what I think, you know, if you look at the physics we understand, Right? Yeah. The, you know, every possibility for faster than light travel really relies on something that doesn't exist. Right? So so, you know, the cool thing is Einstein's field equations. You can actually play with them. The equations are right there. You can add things to the, you know, right or left hand side that allow you to get something like the Accu Trade Drive. That was a metric that, you know, showed you like, oh, it's a warps bubble. It's a warping of space time that moves through space time faster than the speed of light. Right? Because nothing can move across space time faster than the speed of light. But space time itself can move faster than the speed of light. But here's the problem with all of those proposals is they all need something. The thing you added, the little fix term, you added on the into the equations. It's something called exotic matter, and it doesn't exist. It's really just something we dreamed up to make the equation to do what we wanted them to do. So, you know, it's a nice fiction, but really right now, you know, you know, we live in this weird moment in history of the great acceleration where, like, the technology we use now is, you know, is completely different from the technology we used ten years ago. Is remarkably different from the technology from a hundred years ago. But, you know, I remember playing SSENCE Creed where everybody's like, you know, what is it? It's twelve hundred and everybody's like, Damn. Damn. Damn. I was like, yeah. It's a great game. And then I got SSENCE Creed too. And it was three hundred years later, and everybody's like stab stab stab stab. And it was like three hundred years and the technology hadn't changed. And that was actually true for most of human history. Right? You used your great grandfather's tools because there was no need to have any other new tools. And he probably did his job. So, you know, we could be fooled into thinking like, oh, you know, technology is just gonna go on forever. We're always gonna find new advances as opposed to sometimes things just flatten out. For a long time. So you have to be careful about that bias that we have, living in this time of great acceleration. Howard Bauchner: Yeah. But also, it is a great acceleration, and we also are not good at predicting what that entails, if it does, keep accelerating. For example, somebody like Eric Weinstein often talks about we underinvest in theoretical physics research. Basically, like, we're trying too hard for traditional chemical propulsion on rockets versus, like, trying to hack physics sort of warp drives and so on. Yeah. Because it's really hard to do space travel. And it seems like in the long arc of human history, if we survive, the way to really travel cross long distances is going to be some new totally new thing. Right. Right. So it's not going to be an engineering problem. It's going to be a physics A fundamental physics. Fun about the physics problem. Yeah. I mean, I agree with that in principal, but I think there's been, you know, I mean, there's a lot of ideas out there. People, you know, string theory, people have been playing with string theory now for forty years. It's not like people haven't been not like there hasn't been a lot of effort. And, you know, and again, I'm not gonna predict I think it's entirely possible that we have, you know, there's, you know, incredible boundaries of physics that have yet to be poked through. In which case then, all bets are off. Right? Once you get sort of, you know, interstellar, fast interstellar travel, whoa, you know, who knows what can happen? But I I I tend to be drawn to, like, science fiction stories that take the speed of light seriously. Like, what kind of civilization can you build? Where, like, it takes, you know, fifty years to get to where you're going and a fifty years back? Like, So I don't know. I mean, yeah, yeah, there's no way I'm gonna say that that we won't get work drives. But as of right now, there's it's all fictional. It's, you know, it's barely even a coherent concept. Well, it's also a really exciting possibility of hacking this whole thing by extending human lifespan are extending our notion of of time. And maybe as dark as to say, but the value of an individual human life versus the value of life from the perspective of generations. Yeah. You can have something like a generational shift that travels for hundreds of thousands of years. Yeah. And it you're not sad that you'll never see the destination because you kinda have the value for the prolonged survival of humanity versus your own individual life. Yeah. It's a wild ethical question. Is that one of that that book I told you about Aurora? It was I I loved the book because it was such a sort of inversion. Of the usual because, you know, I've read I love science fiction. I've read so many generation ship stories. And they get to that planet. The planet turns out to be uninhabitable. It's inhabited, but it's uninhabitable for Earth. Because again, he has this idea of, like, you know, life is particular to their planets. So they turn around and they come back. And then when they land, the main character goes there's still people who are, you know, arguing for more generation ships and she goes and she punches the guy out because she spent her whole life in a tube, you know, with this. I thought I thought that was a really interesting inversion. You know, the interesting thing about about we were talking about these space habitats. Yes. But if you really had a space habitat, not some super cramped, you know, crappy, the usual version of a century ship. But if you had these like space habitats that were really, you know, like the O'Neil cylinders, they're actually pretty nice places to live. Put a thruster on those. You know? Like, why why keep them in the solar system? Maybe that's maybe space is full of, like, these sort of traveling space habitats that are in some sense, say, you know, they're worlds in them in and of themselves. There's the show'ssilo, which raises the question of, basically, if you're putting on a generational ship, what do you tell the inhabitants of that ship? You might wanna lie to them. Yeah. And why I wanna tell them a story. Right. But they believe Right. Because there is a society. There's human nature. There's, like, how do you maintain homeostasis of that little society? Mean, that's the fascinating technical question, the social question, the psychology question. You know, the generation shift too, and then, you know, which I talked about in the book, the idea of love also the you know, you talked about extending human lifetimes or, you know, the stasis, the cryostasis, which is a main stasis. Of science fiction, you know, that you are right. You can be put to you know, you can basically put in suspended animation and such. None of these things we know are possible. But, you know, it's so interesting. And this is why I love science fiction the way it seeds ideas. Right? All these ideas we're gonna talk about because they've been staples of science fiction for fifty years. Mean, the whole field of cryogenics. Yeah. Where are we at with that? Yeah. I wonder what the state of the art is for a complex organism. How long can you freeze? How long can you freeze and then unfreeze? Right. May maybe, like, with bacteria, you could do freeze Oh, bacteria can last. This is the thing about panspermia. Right, packs. How long can, you know, how long can a bacteria survive in a rock that's been blasted? You know, if there's a common impact across, you know, interstellar distances. That does seem to actually be possible. People've done those kind of calculations. It's not out of the realm of possibility. But a complex organism, multicellular, multisystemic, or multisystems, right, with organs and such? Also, what makes an organism? I mean, it could you know, which part do you want to preserve? Because maybe the for humans, it seems like like, what makes a personality? It feels like you wanna preserve a set of memories. Like, if I woke up on a different body with the same memories, I pretty much I would feel like I'll be the same person. Altered Carbon? Have you would? That's a that's a great series. I think it's on Netflix just because it's, you know, that's a really great series where that's exactly the idea of sleeves. Everybody's able to, like, you know, you can resleeve in another body. And it raises exactly sort of this question. It's not the greatest cyberpunk, but it's pretty good. It's got it's got some great great action sequences too. As we get better and better advancements in large language models that are able to be fine tuned on you It raises a question because I to me, they've already passed the towing test as we traditionally have defined it. Is so if there's going to be an LLM that's able to copy you in terms of language extremely well, it's gonna raise ethical and, I don't know, philosophical questions about what makes you you? Like, what if if there's a thing that can talk exactly like you, like, what is the thing that makes you you? Is it is it It's it's gonna speak about your memories very effectively. This leads us to if we're gonna get to the the blind spot. I I you know, I am of the opinion, heretical in some camps, that, you know, the brain is not the minimal the minimal structure for consciousness. You know, it's the whole body. It's embodied in May, actually, in some sense, it's communities actually. So, yeah, so I don't I mean, you know, I could be wrong. But this is, you know, this is with this whole work that I did with Marcel Glaser and Evan Thompson. Philosophy of science, which is interesting because it leads to this question about, you know, oh, maybe we should just download ourselves into computers. Right? That's another story that that one tells. I'm super skeptical about those. But is that's one of the narratives about interstellar travel is just like and that anybody we meet it's gonna be a machine anyway. Whether it's like whether it's downloaded bodies or it's just gonna be artificial intelligence. Like, there's the whole idea of how long does biological evolution last? Maybe it's a very short period before everybody, you know, goes to or the machines take over and, you know, Kalia, or, you know, it's some hybrid. What do you think aliens look like? So we talked about all the different kinds of biosignatures that might leave or detect no signatures, but what would they look like when we show up? Are they gonna have arms and legs? Are they going to be recognizable at all? Are they gonna be carbon based? Yeah. So great question. And this question gets to the heart of thinking about life, right, about what life is. And this is the physical part of that. There's also sort of the informational part of it. Mhmm. But let's just talk about the physical part of it, which is, you know, life they anything that we're gonna call life is probably gonna work on Darwinian evolution. That's the nice thing about Darwinian evolution. Just like we know, the laws of physics are general. The laws of Darwinian evolution are kind of this logic, this basic logic, that, you know, anything we'd reasonably call life. Probably has to operate under these kinds of principles. And so, you know, evolution is about solving problems that, you know, to survive that the environment presents. And the environment is always gonna present these problems in physical and chemical terms so that you'd expect you'd expect a kind of balance between what we call convergence, evolutionary convergence, and evolutionary contingency. Mhmm. So, you know, if you gotta move along a surface, you know, a a surface between, you know, hard surface and air, then the idea of some kind of jointed stick, right, legs makes sense that you're probably gonna trigger that. You know, if you look at Earth's history multiple times, multiple lineages that had nothing to do with each other are going to solve the problem of getting towards energy sources using some kind of, you know, stick like apparatus. So that's about movement? Yeah. So that's one problem that has to be solved. One problem that has to be solved is I gotta get to food. Right? Another problem is I gotta get away from predators. Right? You've seen wings. We've seen wings the line that went through dinosaurs to birds, evolved wings, insects, evolved wings, mammals evolved wings. If the gas is dense enough that a curved surface, if you move through the curved surface, it's gonna produce lift. Yeah. There you go. Evolutional trip on that. So I think you you you can expect certain classes of solutions to the basic problems that life is gonna is gonna be presented with stay alive, reproduce. But one of the weird things about, like, with the UFO things is that you always see, like, oh, they all look like humans. They're just like basically humans with, you know, triangular heads, and that's where we get to con contingency. Right? So what we've been talking about is convergence. So you expect that evolution will converge on wings multiple times when presented with the problems that wings can solve. But con contingency is accidents. Right? That, you know, you've got something that's evolving a certain kind of wing, a leathery wing. Right? And then, you know, the climate changes and they all die out end of story or, you know, an asteroid. That total accident, asteroids. And so contingency accidents play also a huge role in evolution. And one of the things that, you know, lots of evolutionary biologists have talked about is the idea that if you ran the tape of Earth's history over again, would you get the same creatures? Now Steven Jay Gould was of the opinion that no way, though you wouldn't find anything on Earth that re resembled any species today. They've done experiments actually on this with e coli. You take, you know, you take a bunch of e coli, you let them evolve for a while, you take a bunch of them out, freeze them, let one, you know, let that population continue to evolve. The other one's frozen, now started over again with the frozen. Mhmm. And it seems to be that contingency tends to win. Right? The contingency, at least from what we can tell. I mean, that's not a that's not a hard result. But in those experiments, what you find is that accidents really do matter. So the idea and this is important. So yes, you should expect legs or jointed sticks. How many joints they're gonna be? Anybody's guess. You know, do you expect humanoids, you know, things with a, you know, a sensing apparatus on top of a shoulder with two arms and two legs? That's probably a pretty random set of occurrences that led to that. I guess, what is a brain versus the nervous system? Like, where is most of the cognition competition going on? Yeah. Yeah. You could see that in the organisms. Like, I actually had I I don't know how the brain evolved. Like, why does it have to be in one place? Doesn't have to be. So my favorite word word of the day is liquid brains. Right? This idea of distributed cognition, which fascinating idea, and we've come to understand how much distributed cognition. There is. Obviously, you social animals like termites, etcetera. Mhmm. And hence, that's an example of distributed cognition. The organism is the whole colony. This is one thing that's been really interesting in the state of the study when we cut to for aliens. Is that when we've come to recognize that human intelligence, it's not actually it's been distribute the kinds of things that go into intelligence are distributed all across the biosphere. Lots of different examples of things show various pieces of what we have. Jason Wright will describe it as like a deck of cards. The cards are all there. We got the hand that actually led to the kind of technological progress that we we see. But the kinds of, you know, the basic idea of using tools, the basic idea of recognizing each other eye to eye, all the things that we define as intelligence. You can find many places in many other places across many other line lineages across the earth. So it could be they could be very very different with something like, yeah, maybe that's, you know, the hive mind idea or, you know, bacterial colonies that actually managed to, you know, come to their own version of high cognition? Well, I wonder if there's if we stretch out time across tens, twenty twenty billion years, whether there's an Darwinian evolution stops working at some point in terms of the biology or the chemistry of the organisms and it switches to ideas, for example. It's much more rapidly you're operating maybe, I guess, a kind of Darwinian evolution on the space of memes. So whatever is is is Psychology seems to operate on in in yep. Certainly, markets can operate in ways that look very Darwinian. So basically, a planet is working hard to get to the first kind of organisms that it's able to be a nice platform for ideas to compete. Yeah. And then it kinda stops evolving there, and then then it's ideas that take over. Right. Right. Because yeah. Culture likes it true. It's amazing cultural evolution totally disconnects from from the Darwinian process. But I'd be careful to say that, like, a planet is working hard to do this because, you know, it's really important looking at us. Like, what we think of as ideas and culture and you know, it's quite possible we're gonna make it another two hundred years and this is gone. Right? Because it actually wasn't a very good idea long term. And we just don't know. Also, maybe the idea generation organism is actually the thing that destroys the biosphere because again, but it destroys itself. It may not be very long term. It may be very potent for a short period of time, but that it's not sustainable. It doesn't become like we were talking about before mature. It's very hard to make it into integrated into a mature biotechnosphere. And of course, you know, evolution that is not working for anything. Well, here's actually interesting thing. Right? So people are very much, you know, evolutionary biologists will get very their hair will stand on it. And if you start talking about evolution having a purpose or anything. But the very interesting thing about purpose is that once you do get to a idea generating species or collective organism, yeah, then, you know, kinda all bets are often. There is goals. There is teleology. There is a, you know, the now suddenly, you know, absolutely, there's a direction implied. So that's kind of the cool interesting thing that once you get to that, evolution stops being bulbous and directionless. And suddenly, yeah, we're the ones who supply or any kind of creature like us, has an absolute direction that way they they decide on. Although, you could argue that from a perspective of the entire human civilization, we're also directionless. We have a sense that there's a direction in this cluster of humans. Yeah. And then there's another cluster as a difference as a direction. There's all kinds of religions that are competing. There's different ideologies that are competing. Yeah. And when you just zoom out across if we survive across thousands of years, it will seem directionally. It will seem like a It's a pit boss. It's an unholy mess. But, you know, but at some point, like, the expansion into the solar system. Like, that would be both direction I mean, depending on how you look at it, it was directional. There was a there was a decision that the collective of human beings made to, like, antiareeq to start spreading out into the solar system. So that was definitely a goal there that may have been reached in some crazy sort of, you know, nonlinear way. But it was still right? There was still it's still a goal was set and it was achieved. If there's advanced civilizations out there, what do you think is the proper protocol for interacting with them? Do you think they would be peaceful? Do you think they would be warlike? Like, what do we do next? We detect we detect the civilization through all the technical signatures we've been talking about. Maybe direct imaging, maybe there's really strong signal. We come up with a strategy of how to actually get there. Yeah. But what's the then then the jet process, they always do? Military industrial complex We blocked that movie. Where What kind of rock is? Yeah. Kind of and do we bring rock is? Right. Well, I think, you know, so this will also this is a general question also leads to meta messaging extraterrestrial intelligence. And I am definitely of the opinion of, like, you should be very careful. You know? Like, I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea to have your head below the grass. You know, the people who advocate like, oh, yeah. We should be sending, you know, powerful messages that are easily detectable into interstellar space. I'm like, why would you because we just don't know. Like, I I'm not gonna say they are war like, I'm not gonna say they're not war like, I have no idea. You know, but we sure as hell well, first of all, who gets to decide that? The idea that a bunch of astronomers who happen to have a radio telescope, I don't you know, who who speaks for Earth? I think which I think was a great book somebody wrote. So, you know, the I definitely we should we should be cautious, I would say, because we just have zero information. And the idea you used to have this idea of, well, if they're advanced, they've managed survive. So of course, they're gonna be wearing togas, you know, and be singing kumbaya. But I just wouldn't I just wouldn't assume that. It's also possible though that, like, their cognitive structure is so different that we're not even in living in universe in a certain way. I think we have to be prepared for that. We may not even be able to recognize each other in some way as as cognizing beings. One of my favorite movies is arrival. I don't know if you've ever seen that one. I really love that one because, you know, they literally have different language. They have a different cognitive structure in terms of language, and they're literally kind of living in a different physics. Different physics, different language, different different everything. Yeah. But in the case of arrival, it can at least, like, recognized that they did there. And they managed to cross the language barrier. Yeah. So but that's both sides have an interest in communicating, which you you kind of suppose that an advanced civilization would have a curiosity. Because, like, how do you become advanced without a kind of Yeah. Curiosity about the mysterious about the other? But also, you know, if they're long lived, they may just be, like, we're not even interested. Like, we've done this. We're like, we'd you know, you know, ten ten billion year or sorry, say ten million years ago, we were really interested in that in this in communicating with you, you know, young and young and but now we're not at all. And that's this you know, one of the beauties of this again is how to think about this systematically because you're so far past the hairy edge. Right, of our experience of what we know that you want to think about it. Right? You don't wanna be like, don't know. Can't say anything because that's not fun. But you also have to sort of systematically go after your own biases. Right? One of the things I loved about arrival too was, you know, Carl Sagan always had this idea. Like, we'll teach him math, we'll teach him our math, then they'll teach us their math, and then, you know, we'll be telling each other knock knock jokes, you know, and swapping cures for cancer. And, you know, in the movie, like, they send a Karl Sagen guy in and a linguist. And the Karl Sagen guy fails immediately. Right? And it's a linguist to understand that language is actually embodied. Language is not just something that happens in your head. It's actually the whole experience. And she's the one who breaks through. And it just points to the idea that how utterly different the cognitive structures, the, you know, of of a of a different species should be. So somehow we have to figure out how to think about it, but be so careful of our biases, or figure out, like, a systematic way to break through our biases and not just how make science fiction movies. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of biases. Do you think aliens have visited Earth? You've mentioned that they could have visited and started civilizations that wouldn't we wouldn't even know about it. It was a hundred and million years ago. How can we even begin to answer this question? Whether we've got to look. Gotta look. Gotta figure out ways to look. So I, you know, I mean, I I don't put it. It's not high on my list of, you know, things that I'm I think are probable, but it's certainly it needs to be explored, you know. And unless you look, you never know. So looking on the moon. Look at where would we find if if aliens had passed through the solar system anytime in the last three billion years. Where might we find artifacts? Where might artifacts still be around? Earth probably not because weathering and resurfacing. The moon's a good place. Certain kinds of orbits, you know, maybe they parked a probe in an orbit that was stable, so you gotta figure out which orbits. Actually, you could put something there and it'll last for a billion years. So those are the kind of questions. I I don't like I said, I don't it's not high on my list of thinking this could happen, but it it could happen. I certainly can't unless you look, you don't know. What about speaking of biases? What about if aliens visiting Earth is the elephant in the room, meaning, like, the potential of aliens say seeding life on Earth? You mean, like, in that directed panspermia? Directed panspermia. Yeah. Or seeding some aspect of the evolution. Like two thousand one. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's great story, but, you know, always with the Occam's razor or whatever with science. If I can if I can answer that question without that extra, very detailed hypothesis, than I should. And, you know, the idea that evolution is a natural process, that's what I would go for first. Right? There's there's that just seems it's so much easier to do it that way than adding, you know, sort of because it's kind of a do a duos ex machina. Thing of like, oh, then the aliens came down and they solved that problem that you're trying to solve by just coming down and putting their finger on the scales. So to you, the origin of life, is a is a pretty simple thing that doesn't require an alien. Wouldn't say that. It's not a simple thing, but it doesn't, you know, putting I I think because you know, all you're doing is kicking the can down the road. Right? The aliens something the aliens formed. Right? So you're just saying like, alright. I'm just kicking the can down the road to the aliens? How did they how did what was their a biogenesis event? Well, so from a different perspective, I'm just saying, it seems to me that there's obviously advanced civilizations everywhere throughout the galaxy and through the universe from the Drake equation perspective. And then if I was an alien, what would I do? You know, I've gotten a chance to learn about the uncontacted tribes in the Amazon. At least they went to the Amazon and you get to understand how they function Yeah. And how the humans in the Amazon that are in contact with the sales world, how they interact with their own contact to tribes. First of all, their own contact to tribes are very violent towards the outside world. Mhmm. But everybody else is trying to stay away from them. They try to kinda protect them. Don't talk about them. Don't don't talk about their location and all this kind of stuff. And I've begun to internalize and understand that perspective of why you're doing that. And if I was an alien civilization, if I'd probably be doing a similar kind of thing. And, of course, there's always the teenager of the Troll who's gonna start messing with this stuff or the scientists. Yeah. Yeah. Right? And so it it's not from our perspective, yes. And if you're in the Truman Show, like, Occam's razor. But, like, also, the Occam's razor from the perspective of the LA civilization, we have to have the humility to understand that that interaction will be extremely difficult to detect. That will not be obvious. Right. I understand the logic of what you're saying, but the problem for me with that is that, right, there were the first, you have to assume that alien civilizations are common, which I'm not sure about that might most of them may be dead, or they're not yet still, you know, like, I I well, I think that life is common. And again, this is just my biases. Right? So now the problem is how do we sort out sort of, you know, the the the biases we're bringing or the assumptions we're bringing in from you know, from the the the sort of causal chain that comes out of that. I would first wanna try and do this without, like, you know, for looking at the origin of life or the evolution of life on earth, I'd wanna do it just on its own. Without asking for this other layer. Because it requires a bunch of these other assumptions, which also have their own sort of breaking of causal chains. Because I don't really like, the idea that when you ask what would you do if you were an alien? But again, like alien minds could be so unbelievably different. Right? That they wouldn't even recognize the question you just posed. Right. Right? Because it's just like, you know, we're very much we have a very particular kind of cognitive structure, a cognitive, you know. And and we're very governed by, you know, even if you went and talked to this is an interesting thing to think about, you know, if I could suddenly magically appear a hundred thousand years ago and talk to a hunter gatherer about their worldview and their motivations. You know, I might find something that's like there were no resemblance to things that I think sort of, oh, that's what naturally humans do. Well, let me let me ask you this question. Let's us together do the thought experiment. Yeah. If we either create a time machine that allows us to travel back and talk to them Yeah. Or we discover maybe a primitive alien civilization, on a nearby star system. What what would we do? Yeah. I think that's a great question. I mean, so, you know, it's interesting how that even brings up the ethical questions. Right? That's the thing that, you know, would we we'd have to first sort of sort out what are the consequences for them and what do we feel our ethical responsibilities are to them? And also, sorry, from a capital's perspective, what are we to gain? Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. You look at the way the missionaries, you know, missionaries had these interactions because they thought converting them to whatever religion they were, you know, was the most important. That's what the gain was. So from our perspective, I mean, we'd have to sort that out I think given, you know, for doing this thought experiment, we are curious. And I think eventually, we'd want to reach out to them. I think when you say we let's start with the people in this room. Right? Yeah. There's I wonder who the dominant forces are in the world because I think there's a lot of people, the military. Yeah. They they will probably move first so they can steal whatever advantage they can from this new discovery so they can hurt China or China have hurt America. That's one perspective. Then there's the the capitalist school will see, like, how the benefits and the cost here and how can I make money off of this? There's opportunity here. There's gold. Right. In the hills. And I wonder and I think the scientists is just not going unlike the movies. We're not gonna get much say. They're gonna play them there. Hey, guys. We wait a minute. They would engage probably. I mean, it's just as as a human society as we are now, we would engage. And we would be detectable, I think. In our engagement. In our engagement. Yeah. Yeah. Probably. So using that trivial biased logic, it just it just feels like aliens would need to be engaging in a very obvious way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As it just brings up that old direct for me, paradox for me. What do you make of all the Yale foresightings? I am all in favor of an open agnostic you know, transparent scientific investigation of UFOs and UAPs. But the idea that that there's any data that we have that links UFOs and UAPs to non human technology. I just think they're the standards they just none of what is claimed to be this the data lives up to the standards of evidence. So let's just take a moment on that idea of standards of evidence because I've made a big deal about this, both, you know, in the book, and elsewhere whenever I talk about this. What people have to understand about science is we are really scientists. We are really mean to each other. We are brutal to each other. Because we have this thing that we call standards of evidence. And it's the idea of like, you have a a piece of evidence that you wanna link to a claim. And, you know, under what conditions can you say, oh, look, I've got evidence of, you know, this claim X, Y, and C. And in science, we are so mean to each other about whether or not that piece of evidence lives up to the standards that we haven't. And we spent four hundred years determining what those standards are. And that is why cell phones work. Right? If you didn't have super rigorous standards about, you know, what you think that's, oh, this little antenna. I've invented a new kind of antenna that I can slip into the cell phone and I, you know, I can show you that it works. You know, if you didn't have these standards, you know, you did every cell phone would be a brick. Right? And when it comes to UFOs and UAPs, the evidence you have and the claim that though this shows that, you know, we are being visited by non human advanced civilization just doesn't even come close. To the same standards, I'm gonna have to obey or whatever, live under. If my team, you know, the group I work with is one of them says, look, we've discovered wants to announce that, oh, we've discovered techno signature on an alien planet. We're gonna get shredded as we expect to be. We expect to be beaten up. And, you know, the UAP, UFO community, should expect the same thing. You don't get, you know, you don't get a pass because it's a really cool topic. So that's where I am right now. I just don't think any of the evidence is even close to anything that could support that claim. Well, I generally assign a lot of value to anecdotal evidence from pilots. Not scientific value, but just like, it's always nice to get anecdotal evidence as a first step. So I was like, I wonder if there's something there. But unfortunately, with this topic, there's so much excitement around it. There's a lot of people that are basically trying to make money off of it. There's hoaxes, all this kind of stuff. So Right. Even even if there's some signal, there's just so much noise. It's very difficult to operate it. So How do we get better signal? So you you you talked about sort of if we wanted to really search for your falls on earth Right. And maybe detect things like weird physics. What kind of instruments will we be using? Yeah. So, you know, in the book, I talked about the idea, this is really stupid, but, you know, you you wanna look up, you wanna look down, and you wanna look all around. I think that's brilliant. I mean, that's it's simple, that's stupid. It's like, literally. Right? So you wanna do ground based detectors that, you know, upward looking ground based detectors. Of the kind we're already building for mirrors, right, for tracking mirrors. You wanna have space based detectors, put them on satellites. This is what the NASA UAP panel was thinking about. And then probably on pilot, you know, oh, we have lots of people in the sky. There should be detectors on the planes or at least, you know, some kind of alert system out of some a pilot says, oh, look, I'm seeing something. I don't understand. Boom presses the red button and that triggers the ground based and space based. Data collectors. And then the data collectors themselves, this is something that people really don't understand, and it's so important. In order to actually do science with anything, the data you have, you have to understand where it came from. Like down to the, you know, the nth degree. You have to know how that camera behaves in a bunch of different wavelengths. You have to characterize that. You have to know what the software does, what the limits of the software we have to know what happened to the camera. Was it refurbished recently? In, you know, in every spectral wavelength in all of its data collection and and processing, you have to know all of those steps in having them all characterized. Because especially if you wanna claim like, oh my god, I saw something take a right hand turn at Mach five hundred. Right? You better have all of that nail down before you make that kind of claim. So we have to have characterized detectors looking up down and maybe on on planes themselves. We need a rational search strategy. So let's say you wanna lay out these ground based detectors. Where do you put them? Right? There's only so much money in the world. So, you know, do you wanna put them near places where you've seen a lot of things beforehand? Or do you wanna, you know, have them try and do sparse coverage of the entire country. And then you need the data analyst analysis. Right? You're gonna have so much data, so many false positives or, you know, false triggering, that you need a wave sorting through enormous amounts of data and figuring out what you're gonna throw out and what you're gonna keep. And all these things we're used to doing in other scientific enterprises. And without that, if we don't do that, we're gonna be having the same damn argument about these things for, you know, the next hundred years. But if I ask you, I give you a trillion dollars and ask you to allocate to one place, looking out, SETI, or looking at Earth, which should you allocate? Not looking out. Looking out. Because that's the bet. You know, as I always like to say, here's my my codification of this. If you said, hey, Adam, I'd like to find some Nebraska's. And I said, oh, good. Let's go to the Himalayas. You know? You'd be like, why am I going there? I'm like, well, maybe there's some Himalayas, you know, some Nebraska's in Himalayas. Say, no. No. Let's go to Nebraska. If we're looking for aliens, why don't we look on alien planets where they live? Because that's we have that technology now as opposed to the you know, the the bucket of assumptions that you have to come up with in order to say, like, oh, they're here right now. You know, they just happen to be here right now. And also, the very important thing I called this the high beam argument, you know, to deal with the UFO stuff, you have to deal with all you have to answer these weird irrational things that are happening, like, okay, there is an advanced civilization that is visiting Earth regularly. They don't want to be detected. They've got super powerful technology, but they really suck at using it. Because they we keep seeing them. We keep seeing them, but then they disappear. Right? I mean, explain to me what rational world that works under. It's like, you know, so there's that whole sort of argument you've gotta explain, like, why if they want to stay hidden? Are they so bad at it. So, you know, that's why I take that level of difficulty. And then I put it on top of where should I look? I should look at the the, you know, I should look at where they where they're from. That makes me wanna look at do the telescopic stuff. Yeah. I think the more likely explanation is either the sensors are not working correctly or it's this secret military technology being tested. Absolutely. I mean, if you had listen. That's what, again, I think UAP you know, absolutely UAP should be studied scientifically. But if I had to make a bet and it's just a bet, I would say this is, you know, this is pure state adversary stuff. When I did I did a a New York Times op ed for this in twenty twenty one, which, you know, blew up And and so, you know, I had a lot of, you know, people talking to me. While I was doing that, I sort of looked at the signals intelligence people, the SIGINT and and eInt electronic intelligence communities and what they were saying about, you know, the New York Times articles and the the various videos, and really none of them were talking about UFO's. They were all talking about, you know, pure state. That's why I learned the word, pure state adversaries. How, like, even simple drone technologies? You can you know, and you wanna you purposely wanna do this. You want to fake, you know, signals into the electronic of your of that. Sorry. So they crank it up. Mhmm. So then you can just soak up all the electromagnetic radiation and know exactly what those advanced radars can do. That said, I'm not saying that that's what this is. If I was the head of an alien civilization. And I chose to not to minimize the amount of contact I'm doing. Mhmm. I would try to figure out what would these humans what would these aliens like to see. That's why, like, the big heads in the humanoid form. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean, that's kinda, like, how it I would approach communication. If I if I was much more intelligent, I would observe them enough. It's like, alright. If I wanted to communicate with a nail com colony Right. I would observe it long enough to see what are the basic elements of communication. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe I would do a trivial thing, like, do a, like, a fake ant. Right. You know, a robot ant or a robot ant, but then it's not enough to just do a robot ant. You have to do a robot ant that, like, moves in the way they do. And maybe Ellen is just shitty at doing the robot hands. But no. I I do sort of I just wanted to make the case for this. This is the plot actually of a great science fiction book called EON by Greg Bayer. And the idea was like these sort of, you know, this would this is actually where my first I got I I I became sort of a more than agnostic anti meddy because the idea is that, yes, our aliens come. They, you know, they sort of make their arrival. And really, their point is to get rid of us. It's the it's the dark forest hypothesis. And what they do is they sort of literally the way they present themselves is in this sort of classic UFO thing. And they do it, and they, you know, they arrive at the u this was during the Soviet Union. They arrive at the USSR. They arrive in China. And they're kind of faking us out to so that we never can organize ourselves against it was really they did exactly kinda what you're talking about, but for nefarious purposes. Okay. Let me ask the Podhead question. Another yet another pod Another pod The most conversations I'm sorry. Boggs before breakfast. It's it's science and podhead questions back and forth. Okay. What if aliens take a form that's unlike what we kind of traditionally envision in analyzing physical objects? What if they take the form of, say, ideas? What if real pothead is that consciousness itself, like this objective experience, it's an alien being, maybe ideas and it's an easier one to visualize because we can think of ideas as entities trailing from human to human. When I made the claim that the most important data that finding life, any kind of life would be the most important discovery in human history. And one of the reasons is, again, as I said that, you know, life, if we're not an accident, and there's other life, then there's probably lots of other life. And because the most significant thing about life is it can innovate. Right? If I give you a star and, you know, give tell you the mass and the composition, you can basically pretty much use the laws of physics exactly what's gonna happen to that star over its entire lifetime. Maybe not the little to any details, but overall, it's gonna be a white dwarf. It's gonna be a black hole in the story. If I gave you a single cell and said what's gonna happen in a few billion years, you'd never be able to predict a giant rabbit that can punch you in the face. Right? Like a kangaroo. So life has this possibility of innovating of being creative. So here's So what it means is and that's a part of a kind of a fundamental definition of what it means to be alive. It goes past itself. So give life enough time You know? And what are the what are the end result? Like, you know, there's there's yeah. Like, that's why I love science fiction so much. Does at some point, does life reach a point where it climbs into the laws of physics itself. It becomes the laws of physics or, you know, these these sort of lie at the the the extreme limits of thinking about what what we mean by reality, what we mean by, you know, experience. But I'm not sure there was much we can do with them scientifically. But it it you know, their their open ended question about the open ended nature of what it means to be alive and what life can do. Since you said it's the biggest question, which is an interesting thought experiment. What is the biggest scientific question we can possibly answer? You know, some people might say about, like, what happened before the big bang, like, and some big physics questions about the universe. I could see the argument for, you know, how many alien civilizations or if there's other life out there. You wanna speak to that a little bit? Like, what? Why is the why is it the biggest question in your why is it number one in your top five? Or I I've evolved in this. Right? I I started off as a theoretical physicist. I went into computational astrophysics and magnetohydrodynamics of star formation. I always say I was a philosophy minor. I always had these sort of bigger questions sort of floating around the back of my mind. And what I've come to now is the most important question in the for physics is what is life? What the hell is the difference between a rock and a cell? Fundamentally. And what I really mean by this, and this is where I'm gonna go nontraditional. Is that really the fundamental question? That is the is agency. What does it mean to be an autonomous agent? How the hell is that? Happen. You know, it's so I'm not a reductionist. I'm not somebody who's just like, well, I just put together enough chemicals in Bing Bing boom and, you know, it suddenly appears. There's something really is gonna demand a preconception of what nature itself is. And so, yeah, black holes are super cool. Cosmology is super cool. But really, this question of of what is life, especially from by viewing it from the inside because it's really about the verb to be. Right? Really, what is the most What is the most impressing philosophical question beyond science? Is the verb to be? What is what is being? Right? This is what Steven Hawking said. One of you talked about what what what puts the fire in the equations? The fire. Right? The fire is this this presence, and this is where it touches things like, you know, whatever you wanna say, the sacred spirituality, whatever you wanna talk about. My first book was about science and and human spirituality. So it's like, you know, so this question of life, what makes life as a physical system? You know, so different is is to me much more. Because it's, you know, that's where being appears. Being doesn't appear out there. Right? The only place that ever appears to any of us is us. So, you know, I can do this kind of projection into this third person thing, but nobody ever has that, that god's eye view. That's a story we tell. This is where, you know, this between us is where the verb to be appears. So this is something that you write about in the blind spot. Why science cannot ignore human experience, sort of trying to pull the fire into the the process of science. And it's a kind of critique of materialism. Can you explain the main thesis of this book? Yeah. So the idea of the blind spot is that there is this thing that is central to science. So the blind we're using the blind spot as a metaphor. Right? So the eye has an optic nerve, and the optic nerve is what allows vision to happen So you can't have vision without the optic nerve. But actually, you're blind to the optic nerve. There's a little hole in your vision where the optic nerve is. And what we're saying is that science has something like this. There is something that without which science would not be possible, but that science the way it's been configured. And actually, when we mean the blind spot and get into exactly what I mean, what it is. But it's not really science. It is a it is a set of ideas that got glued on to science. It's a metaphysics that got glued on to science. And so what is that thing that is what is the blind spot? It's experience. It is presence. And if I experience that people have to be very careful because I'm not talking about being an observer. It's the, you know, there's lots of words for it. There's direct experience. There is presence. Being the life world within the philosophy called phenomenology, there's the life world. It's this sort of raw presence that you can't get away from until you die. And who the hell knows? You know, that that, like, you know, as long as you're around, it's there. And what we're saying is that that is the the way to say this, that is the the precondition for the possibility of science. And the whole nature of science, the way it has evolved, is that it it purposely pushed that out. It pushed that out so it could make progress. And that's fine for a certain class of problems. But when we try to answer when we try and go deeper, there's a whole other class of problems, the nature of consciousness, the nature of time, quantum mechanics, that comes back to bite us. And that if we don't learn how to take understand that that is always the background, that experience is always the background, then we just end up with these paradoxes and problems yoga that that require this intellectual yoga to get out of. I think you give a bunch of examples of that, like looking at temperatures, a number. There's a very sort of objective, scientific way of looking at that, and then there's the experience of the temperature. And how you build the power of temperature that we we call it? So what what is the blind spot? We use the term. It's a constellation. It's not just materialism. It's a constellation of ideas that are all really sort of philosophical views. They're not what science says, but because of the evolution of the history of science and culture, they got, like, pinned the tail in the donkey. They were sort of pinned on and to tell us that this is what science says. So what do I say? One is reductionism, that you are nothing but your nerve cells, which are nothing but the chemistry, which is nothing but, you know, all the way down to quarks. That's it. That's reductionism. The objective frame, that science gives us this god's eye view, this third person view of the world, to view the world from the outside, that that's what science, you know, equates to us, that view. Physicalism, that everything in the world is basically made of stuff there's nothing else to talk about. Right? That that's all there is and everything can be reduced to that. And then also the reification of mathematics that mathematics is somehow more real than this. And there's a bunch of other things, but all these together what they all do is they end up pushing experience out and saying experience is an epi phenomena. Consciousness. I I don't I tend not to use the word consciousness because it's I think it gets you know, it leads us in the wrong direction. We should focus on experience because it's a verb kind of in a way, it's verb it's verb like. So, yeah, and that this By being blind to that, we end up with these paradoxes and problems that really not only block science, but also have been detrimental to society as a whole, especially where we're at right now. So you you actually say that that from a perspective of detrimental society that there's a crisis and meaning and that we respond to that in a way that's counterproductive to these bigger questions, scientific questions. So the three ways the three responses you mentioned is scientific triamfulism. And then on the other side is rejecting SaaS completely, both on the left and the right. I think the postmodernist on the left and the anti establishment people on the right. And then just pseudoscience that kinda does this in between thing. Can you just speak to those responses and to the crisis of meaning? Right. Right. So the crisis of meaning is that, you know, on the one hand, science wants to tell us that we're insignificant. We're not important. We're just, you know, biological machines. And, you know, so we're basically an insignificant part of the universe. On the other hand, we also find ourselves being completely significant In cosmology, we have to figure out how to look from the inside at cosmology. We're always the observers. We're at the center of this, you know, collapsing wavefront of light. You know, quantum mechanics, it really comes it. It comes in, you know, the measurement problem just puts us front and center, we spent a hundred. Some people spend a hundred years trying to ignore the measurement part of the measurement problem. So on the one hand, we're insignificant, and on the other hand, we're central. So which one is it? Right? And so this all comes from not understanding actually the foundational role of experience. This inability. We can't. It's We can't do science without already being present in the world. We can't reduce what happens in science to some sort of formal It's real lot of it is about We love our formal systems. You know, our mathematics and we're substituting. That's one of the things that we there's two philosophers we really like for our heroes. One is Herserl, who's a mathematician, who invented phenomenology. And the other is Whitehead, who's one of the greatest mathematicians. Of the twentieth century. And Herschel came up with this idea of the surreptitious substitution. Part of the blind spot is substituting a formal system, a calculus of, you know, data for actual experience. That's more important then And so let me just do before I go to those three responses, let's just do the parable of temperature because I think it'll People cannot It'll it'll help them understand what we mean. So think about degree Celsius. Right? We kinda have in this modern scientific culture we live in. We think like, oh, yeah. Degrees Celsius. They're out there. The universe, you know, the the molecular cloud in space is ten degrees, you know, Kelvin. The way we got there is we've forgotten how that idea is rooted in experience. Right? We started off with science, but we had the the subjective experience of hot and cold. I feel hot. I I feel cold. You feel hot. You feel cold. Science was this process of trying to extract from those experiences what Michelle Bidpole philosopher calls the structural invariance. The things that, like, we could both kinda do agree on. So, you know, we figured out, like, oh, we could make a gradiated little cylinder that's got mercury in it and that, you know, hot things will be higher in that, you know, on that gradient descent or cold things will be lower, and we can both kind of figure out what we're gonna agree on our standards for that. And then we have thermometry. Yay. We have a wave sort of, like, having structural and variant of this sort of very personal experience of hot or cold. And then from that, we can come up with thermodynamics, etcetera. And then we end up as at the bottom of, you know, at the end of that, this idea of, like, everyday wake up and I check my phone and I'm like, oh, it's gonna be, you know, sixty degrees out, great. And we start thinking that sixty degrees is more real than hot and cold. The thermodynamics, the whole formal structure of thermodynamics is more real than the basic experience of hot and cold that it came from. You know, it required that bodily experience that also it's not just me you. I have to tell you, it's part of my communication with you. Cold today, isn't it? Right? That from that basic irreducible experience of being in the world, you know, with everything that involves, I developed degrees Celsius, but then I forgot about it. I forgot the experience. So that's called the amnesia of experience. So that's what we mean by the, you know, how the blind spot emerges, how we end up, how science purposely pushes experience out of the way, so it can make progress. But then it forgets that experience was important. So where does the show up? Why is this you know, what are the responses to trying to get this back in? And where where where this crisis of meaning emerge? So scientific triumphalism is the idea that only the only thing that's true for us are scientific truths. Right? Unless it can be codified in a formal system, it represented as data you know, captured in some kind of scientific causal network, it doesn't even exist. Right? And any anything else that's not part of it, part that can be formalized in that way is an epi phenomenon. It's not real. So, you know, scientific triumphalism is this response to to the miss you know, the weirdness of, you know, like you called the mister, the weirdness of experience by kind of just ignoring it completely. So there's no other truth, you know, art music, you know, human spirituality. It's all actually reducible just to neural, you know, neural correlates. So that's one way that it's been dealt with. The other way is this sort of right you've got on the on the little the post modern, you know, the left, academic left, you get this thing like, Science is just a game. You know, it's just a game by from from the the powerful come up with, which is also not true. Science is totally potent and requires an account for what is happening. So that's another way to push sort of science away. Or respond to it. The denial, science denial that happens, that's also another way of of sort of, you know, not understanding the balance that science is trying that we need to establish with experience. And then there's just pseudoscience, which wants to sort of say, like, oh, you know, the new age movement or whatever, which wants to have, you know, wants to deal with experience by kinda elevating it in this weird pseudospirational way or, you know, it said that doesn't have the rigor of science. So, you know, all of these ways all of these responses, we have this difficulty about experience. We need to understand how experience fits into the web of meaning. And we don't really have an accurate don't have a good way of doing it yet. And the point of the book was to identify very clearly how the problem manifests, what the problem is, and what its effects are in the various sciences. And by the way, we should mention that at least the first two responses, they kind of feed each other. There's a just to observe the scientific community, those who sort of gravitate a little bit towards the scientific trifleism, they there's an arrogance that builds in the human soul. If you I mean, it has to do with PhDs. It has to do with sitting on the academic throne. All all of those things and the match human nature with the egos and so on. It builds. And, of course, that nobody likes Arriguez. And so the dose that reject science, that the arrogance is fuel for the Yeah. They reject science. I absolutely agree. It just goes back. And it's just it's just divided that builds. Yeah. No. And that was a problem, like, when you saw so like I said, you know, my first book was about science and human spirituality. So I was trying to say that, like, you know, Science is actually If we look at what happens in human spirituality, not religion. Religion's about politics. Right? But about, you know, for the entire history of the species, we've we've had this experience of for a better lack of a better word, the sacredness. I'm not connecting this god or anything. I'm just saying this experience of, like, the more. And then, you know, with the new atheist movement, you got people saying that, like, anybody who feels that is an idiot. You know, they just can't handle the hardcore science. When in fact their views of the world are so denuded of it because they can't even see the role that experience plays and how they came up with their formal systems. You know, and experience fundamentally is weird, you know, mysterious. It's like it's it's, you know, kind of goes down forever in some sense. There is always more. So, yeah, that arrogance then just if you're telling everybody who's not hardcore enough to do the, you know, standard model of cosmology, that they're idiots, that's not gonna bode well for your, you know, the advance of your project. So you're proposing at least to consider the idea that experience is a this fundamental experience is not just an illusion that emerges from the set of quirks that there could be something about the conscious experience of the world that is, like, at the core of reality. Yeah. But I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't because, you know, there's panpsychism. Right? Which ones I would say that's all the way there. Yeah. Panpsychism is, like, that's literally one of the laws of physics. Right. Right. Because what all those do is, like, just the idea of say, like, physicalism versus idealism, which are kind of the two philosophical schools you can go with physicalism says, all that exists is physical. Idealism says, all that exists is mind. We're actually saying, look, both of these, to take either of those positions, is already to project out into that third person view. Right? And that third person view, we wanna really emphasize, is a fiction. It's a useful fiction when you're doing science. Right? If I wanna do, like, you know, the the newtonian physics, a beward balls on a pool table, great. I don't wanna have to think about experience at all. Right? But, you know, if I'm asking deeper questions, I can't ignore the fact that there really is no third person view. And that any story I tell about the world is coming from It's not just first person, but it's literally because I I'm gonna argue that experience always involves all of us. Experience always originates out of a community. That, you know, you're always telling those stories from the perspective of already existing. Of already being inexperienced. So whatever account we wanna give is of the world is gonna have to take that as experience as being irreducible and the irreducible starting point. So ultimately, Like, we don't have an answer. Like, that's when people are like, well, what are you suggesting as your alternative? It's like, look, that's the good work of the next science to come. Well, our job was to point out the problem with this. But what we would argue is, and we're thinking about the next book, is this is really gonna require a new conception of nature. Right? That doesn't sort of jump right to that third person, that fictional third person view, and somehow figures out how to do science, recognizing that it always starts from experience. It always starts from this field of experience or or in phenomenology of the world is the life world. That you're embedded in, you can't unembed yourself from it. So how do you do so so that one of the the things that Whitehead said was, you know, we have to avoid the bifurcation of nature. And what he meant by that is the bifurcation into, like, sort of, scientific concepts, wavelength you know, think about, like, the seeing a sunset. You can say, like, oh, look, it's just wavelengths, you know, and scattering particles, and your experience of the redness, the actual experience of the redness, and all the other things, it's not just red. There's no quality. There's no pure redness. Everything that's happening in the experiential part is just an epi phenomenon. It's just, you know, brain states, whatever. He said you can't do that. They're just they're both real. They're both accounts. They're both need to be integrated. And so that required, I think, a really a different conception of what we mean by nature. Is it something like incorporating in the physics, in the study of nature, the observer, the experiencing observer, or is that still also looking from a third person? Think that that's what we have to figure out. Right? And so, actually, you know, a great place to think about this is quantum mechanics. Right? Because one of the things we're arguing is, like, look, in the in the chapter that I wrote on because it was I wrote this with Evan Thompson who's a wonderful philosopher and Marcello Glaser who's a theoretical physicist. When I was writing a chapter on the origin of the blind spot, like, you know, sort of what how this emerged out of history. My I the subheader was, like, well, it made sense at the time. Because it did. You know, it really there was a reason why people adopted this third person God's eye deterministic view. This view of sort of like, you have the perfect clockwork of the universe. Yeah. Totally made sense. But by the time you got to the beginning of the twentieth century, science itself was telling you like, and no place does disappear more than in quantum mechanics. Right? Quantum mechanics slambs you with the idea that the of the measurement problem, you know? The and most important thing about quantum mechanics is you have a dynamical equation, the schrodinger equation, which, you know, you put in like we talked about before, you have initial conditions. Now you got a differential equation and you crank out the differential equation, and it makes predictions for the future. Right? Exactly like newtonian physics or it's higher versions of La Lagrange or Hamiltonians. But then this other thing happens where it's like, oh, by the way, as soon as you look at it, as soon as the measurement is made, I have a whole another set of rules for you. You know, that's the born, what we call the born rule. And it was telling you right from the beginning that measurement matters. Right? So when you're asking, like, how will we do this? Quantum mechanics is actually pointing to how to do it. So, you know, they've done all these different interpretations of the quantum mechanics. Many of them try to pretend the measurement problem isn't there. Go to enormous lengths like the the many world's interpretation. Literally inventing an infinite number of unobservable parallel universes to avoid the thing that quantum mechanics is telling them, which is that measurements matter. And then you get something like cubism, which is I'm gonna advocate for, is a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, which puts the born rule at the center. Right? Instead of like focusing on the Schrodinger equation and the weird things that come out of it like Schrodinger's cat and all that other stuff, it says, no, no, actually the real mystery is the born rule. Let's think about the born rule. And like you said, that puts the agent the agent and information at the center of the whole thing. So that's not a thing you're trying to get rid of. That's that's the thing you're trying to integrate at the center of the thing. In quantum mechanics, it becomes super obvious, but maybe this same kind of thing should be incorporated in in every layer of of study of nature. Absolutely. That's exactly it. So, you know, one of the things that's really interesting to me. So, I I mean, I have a project. I'm part of a big project that Chris Fooks and Jocsenior on cubism. So I've been part of that. And what I've been amazed by is the language they use. So what's cool about cubism is it comes from quantum information theory. It's a pretty modern version of thinking about quantum mechanics. And it's always about, do you have an agent who makes an action on the world. And then the information they get from that action through the the experiment, that's the action in the world, updates their priors, updates their their, you know, their bayesian. That's why it's called cubism, quantum bayzianism. Updates how the information have gotten from the world. Now, this turns out to be It's kind of the same language that we're using in a project that's about the physics of life where we have a grant from the Templeton Foundation to look at semantic information and the role of semantic information in living systems like cells. So, you know, we have Shannon information, which is a probably distribution that tells you, you know, basically how much surprise there is in a in a message. Semantic information focuses on meaning. Right? Focuses on and in a very simple way, just like, what is how much of the information that I'm that the agent, you know, the critter is getting from the world, actually has helps it survive. Right? That's the most basic idea of meaning. Right? We can get all philosophical about meaning, but this is it. Does it help me stay alive or not? And the whole question of agency and autonomy that occurs in this setting of just asking about how do cells move up a a chemical gradient to get more food? Kinda has the same feel, the same, you know, sort of architecture as what's going on in quantum mechanics. So I think what you said is exactly it. How do we bring this sort of recognition that there's always us the agent or life the agent interacting with the world and drawing in both giving information and passing information back as a way of of doing science, doing hardcore science with experiments but never forgetting that agency, which also means experience in some sense, is at the center of the whole thing. So you think that could be something like cubism, quantum visionism, that creates a theory like a Nobel Prize winning theory sort of like hardcore real theories that put the agent at the center. Yes. That's what we're looking for. I think that is really that's the exciting part and it's a move you know, the scientific trampolist thing says, you know, if you understand why people would love this, like, I have these equations and these equations represent, you know, this this platonic idea that they are, you know, they exist eternally on their own. It's kind of quasi religious. Right? It's sort of like somehow look these equations are the you're reading the mind of God. But this other approach to me is just as exciting because what you're saying is, there's us and the world. They're inseparable. Right? That's always us and the world. And what we're now finding about is this kinda cocreation, this this interaction, you know, between the agent and the world, such that these powerful laws of physics that need an account, like in no way am I saying these laws aren't important, these laws are amazing. But they need an account, but not an account that strips, you know, that turns the experience, turns the agent into just a, you know, an epi phenomena, that it pushes the agent out and makes it seems if the agent's not the most important part of the story. So if you pull on this thread and say there's a whole discipline born of this putting the agent as the primary thing in a theory, in a physics theory, like how is it possible it just, like, breaks the whole thing open? So there's this whole effort of, you know, unifying quantum relativity and quantum mechanics of, like, coming up with the theory of everything. What if these are, like, the tip of the iceberg? What what if the the agent thing is, like, really important? So, you know, listen, that that would be like kind of my dream. I'm not gonna be the one to do it because I'm not smart enough to do it. But, you know, Marcelo and I have for a while have been sort of critical of where foundational physics has been for a while with string theory. It's been my whole life listening to talks about string theory real soon, you know. And it's gotten ever more disconnected from, you know, data observations. There were people talking for a while that it's post empirical. And, you know, I wanna always wanted to write a paper or an article that was, like, physicists have been smoking their own stash. Right? There's this way we've gotten used to, like, you know, you have to outweird the other person. But, like, my theory is thirty eight dimensions. My theory is twenty two dimensions, but it's got, you know, you know, psychedelic squirrels in it. And so there's been a prop there's a problem. Now, I don't need to tell you there's a crisis in physics or there's a crisis in cosmology. Other people have used that. That's been the the headline on scientific American stories. So there clearly, another direction has to be found. And maybe it has nothing to do with this. But I suspect that because so many times the agent or the the the having to deal with the the the view from the inside or the the the role of agency. Like when it comes to time, thinking that you can replace the block universe with the actual experience of time. You know, clocks don't tell time. We use clocks to tell time. So maybe that even like the fundamental nature of time can't be viewed from the outside. That there's a a new physics theory that is gonna come from that comes from this a general informational, computational view. I don't know, but that's kind of what I I I think it would be fertile ground to explore. Yeah. Like, time is really interesting one. This time is really important to us humans. What is time? Yeah. That's a right. What is time? So the way we have tended to view it is we've taken this is what when Herschel talks about the syrups, you're substitution. We've taken Einstein's beautiful, powerful, formal system for viewing time, and we substituted that for the actual experience of time. Right? So the block universe where, like, next Tuesday is already written down. You know, it's in the block universe, the four dimensional universe, all events are already there, which is very potent for making certain kinds of predictions within the sort of, you know, the scientific framework. But you know, it is not lived time. And, you know, this was pointed out to Einstein, and he eventually recognized it. Very famous meeting between Andre Burksen, who was the most famous philosopher of, like, the, you know, twenty, early, twentieth century. And Einstein, where Einstein was giving a talk on relativity and Berksen whose whole thing was about time and was about duration. He wanted to separate the scientific image of time, the map of time from the actual terrain which he used the word duration. Like we humans where where duration for us is full. It's it's sort of it's stretched out. It's got a little bit of the past, a little bit of the future, a little bit of the present. Music is the best example. Right? You're hearing music You're both already anticipating what's going to happen and you're remembering what's going on. There's a kind of phenomenal structure there, which is different from the representation of time that you have with the formal mathematics and what, you know, the way we would look at this is that the problem with the syrup tissue substitution, the problem with the blind spot is it says, oh, no, no. The formal system is time. But really, the only place time appears is with us. Right? We're we're time you know, so having a theory that actually could start with us, you know, and then stretch out into the universe rather than imposing this imaginary third person view back on us, you know, could that's a route towards a different way of approaching the whole problem. I just wonder who is the observer? I mean, define what the agent is. Right. In any kind of frame is difficult. Is difficult. Right? And so that but that's the good work of the science ahead of us. Right? What what happened with this idea of the structural invariance I was talking about so, you know, we start with experience, which is irreducible. There's no atoms of experience. Right? It's a whole. And we go through the whole process, which is a communal process, by the way. There's a philosopher Robert Kriese who talks about the workshop. Starting in like the seventeen hundred, sixteen hundreds. We developed this communal space to work in. Sometimes it was literally a physical space, a laboratory where these ideas would be pulled apart, refined, argued over, and then validated, and we went to the next step. So this idea of pulling out from experience these thinner abstract structural invariance, the things that we could actually do science with. And it's kind of like we call it ascending spiral of abstraction. Right? So The problem with the way we do things now is we take that those abstractions, which came from experience. And then with something like, you know, a a a computational model of consciousness or experience, we think we can put it back in. Like you literally pulled out these super thin things, these abstractions, you know, neglecting experience because that's the only way to do science. And then you think somehow, oh, I'm gonna put I'm gonna jam experience back in and and, you know, have an explanation for experience. So do you think it's possible to show that something like free will is quote unquote real if you integrate experience back into this physics into the physics model of the world? What I would say is that free will is is a given that's the thing about experience. Right? So one of the things that Whitehead said, I really love this quote, he says, it's not the job of either science or philosophy to account for the concrete. It's the job to account for the abstract. The the concrete what's happening between us right now is just given. You know? It's just it's presented to us. Every day, it's presented to If you want an exclamation fine, but the exclamation actually doesn't add anything to it. Right? So that free will in some sense is the nature of being an agent. Right? To be an agent, agency and autonomy are sort of the two things that are, you know, they're they're equivalent. And so in some sense, to be an agent is to be autonomous. And so then the question really to ask is, can you have an account for agency and autonomy? That captures aspects of it's it's arising in the world or the way it and the world sort of coarise. But the idea you know, the reason why we argue about free will often is because we already have this blind spot view that the world is deterministic. Because of our equations, which themselves, we treat the equations as if they're more real than experience. You know, and the equations are a paler, you know, they don't corral experience. They are a thinner representation as we like to say, don't confuse the map for the terrain. What's happening between us right now and this, you know, all the weirdness of it, that's the terrain. The map is what I can write down on equations and then in the workshop do experiments on. Super powerful, needs an account, but experience overflows that. What if the experience is an illusion? Like, how how do we know? What if the agency that we experience is an illusion? An illusion looking from where? Like, right, because that already acquirers to just take that stance is you've already pushed yourself into that third person view. Right? And so what we're saying is that's a that third person view, which now you're gonna say, like, oh, I've got a whole other set of entities of ontological entities, meaning, you know, things that I think exist in god's living room in spite, you know, that are independent of me and the community of living things on part of. So you're pushing it elsewhere. It's just like there's a stack of turtles. It's probably if if this experience human experience is an illusion. Maybe there's an observer for whom it's not an illusion. So you always have to find an observer somewhere. Yeah. Right. And that's where that's why, you know, fundamentally, the the blind spot that especially the scientific triumphalist part is is following a religious impulse. You know, it's wanting the god's eye view. And you know what's really interesting and when we think about this and the way this gets talked about especially publicly. You know, there's a line of philosophical inquiry that this language gets couched in and it is actually a pretty it's only one version of philosophy. Right? So it is pretty much what we call the analytic tradition. Right? But there's even in Europe, in the or or in the Western tradition, in the, you know, for Western, what we'll call Western philosophy, there's phenomenology. There's a Hersheyroll, and Heidiger, and Merlupati, which took an entirely different track. They were really interested in the structure of experience. They spent all their time trying to understand, trying to develop a language that could kind of climb into the circle, that is experience. Right? You experience, you're not gonna be able to start with axioms and work your way to it. It's over it's given. So you have to kinda jump in and then try and find a language to account for its structure. But then so that that has not been part of this discussion about. You'll never good luck finding a YouTube video where someone, you know, a famous scientist is talking about science from a phenomenological point of view, even though it's a huge branch of philosophy. And then you get the philosophies that occurred from other cores of civilization. Right? So there's the there's the western core out of which comes to Greeks and the, you know, the Judeo Christian Islamic tradition. But then you get India and you get Asia, and they developed their own. They were highly complex societies that developed their own responses to these questions. And they for reasons, because they had contemplative practice. They were very focused on, like, direct trying to, like, directly probe attention and experience. They asked questions in ways that the west never really did phenomenology kinda started it, but, you know, there's there's philosophers like Nagartina and Fosu Bong doing. And they're like the Plato and the, you know, Aristotle of, you know, sort of, those philosophies. And they were really focused on experience. In the west, I think maybe because we had the Judeo Christian tradition where we already had this kind of God who's gonna be the frame on which you could always point to that frame. The in the the traditions that came from the classical philosophies of India and Asia They started always with it. They wanted to know about experience. Their whole philosophies and their logic and their their argumentation was based on, I've got this experience. I can't get out of this experience. How do I reason from it? So I think there's like a lot of other philosophical traditions that we could draw from. You know, not like slavishly. We don't all have to become Buddhist to do it, but there are traditions that really tried to work this out in a way that the western traditions just didn't. But there's also the practical fact that is difficult to build a logical system on top of experience. It's difficult to have the rigor of science on top of experience. And so it's as science advances, we might get better and better. Look the same as it's very difficult to have any kind of mathematical or kind of scientific rigor to why complexity emerges from simple rules and simple objects, sort of the Santa Fe questions. Yeah. I think but I think we can do it. I think there's aspects I mean, as long as you're never trying to, like, this is what experience is. Like, I think that's kind of the where you know, there you're never gonna have a causal account of experience because it's just given, but you can do lots about and that's what the good work is. Is to how do I approach this? How do I approach this in a way that's rigorous that I can do experiments with also? But so for example, I was just reading this beautiful paper that was talking about in the, you know, this is what we're counting with our semantic information to causal closure. Love this idea. Right? The idea that so we've talked about auto poeices a while back. Right? The idea that living systems are They are self creating and self maintaining. So the the membrane cell membrane is a great example of this. Right? Cell membrane. You can't have a cell without a cell membrane. The cell membrane lets stuff through, keeps other stuff out. Right? But the cell membrane is part of the processes and it's a product of the processes that the cell membrane needs. Right? In some sense, the self membrane creates itself. So there's this strange it's always with life. There's always this strange loop. Mhmm. And so somehow figuring out how to jump into that strange loop is you know, the science that's ahead of us. And so this idea of causal closure, accounting for how the, you know, we talk about, like, downward causation. Right? So reductionism says, everything only depends on the microstate. Everything just depends on the atom. Right? That's it. You don't read it. If you know if you know the Lagrangian for the standard model, you're done. You know? Of course, in principle, you need God's computer, but fine. You know, in principle, it can be done. Cost of closure. And there's I was just reading this great paper that sort of argues for this. There's ways in which using Epsilon machines and all this machinery from information theory that you can see ways in which the system can organize itself so that it decouples from the microstates. Now the macrostate fundamentally no longer needs the microstate for its own description, its own account of the laws. Whether that paper is true or not, it's an example of heading down that road. There's also Robert Rosensworth. He was a theoretical biologist. Who he was you know, he talked about closure to efficient cause, that that living systems, you know, are organizationally closed, or are causally closed so that they don't depend anymore in the microstate. And he made the he had a proof which is very contentious. Nobody knows if it's, you know, some argue it's true, some argue it's not. But he said that because of this, living systems are not church turned complete. They cannot be represented as formal systems. So, you know, in that way, they're not axioms. They're not Living Systems will not be axioms. They can only be partially captured by algorithms. Now, again, people fight back and forth about whether or not his proof was, you know, is is valid or not. But I'm saying them giving you examples of, like, you know, when you when you see the blind spot, when you acknowledge the blind spot, it opens up a whole other class of kinds of scientific investigations. You know, the book we thought was gonna be really heretical. Right? You know, obviously, you know most that most public facing scientists are very sort of in that especially scientific trampoline. So we were just like waiting, you know, waiting for the fight. And then the review from science came out and it was like totally pro you know, they was very positive. We're like, Oh my god. You know? And then a review came out in Nature Physics, and it was totally positive. And then a review came out in The Wall Street Journal because we kinda criticized, not capitalism, but we criticized sort of all industrial economies for that they were sort of had been touched by the blinds behind socialism communism. It doesn't matter. These extractive, you know, and sort of had that sort of view that the world is just reducible to, you know, resources. The Wall Street Journal gave us a great review. So it feels like there's actually out there, there is some among working scientists in particular, there is some dissatisfaction with this triumphalist view and a recognition that we need to shift something in order to like jump past these hurdles that we've been arguing about forever, and we're not, you know, we're sort of stuck in a vortex. Well, it is I mean, I think there is a hunger to acknowledge that there's an elf in the room like that. We're just removing the the agent. Yeah. Like, it's everyone is doing it. And it's like, yeah. Yeah. We there's the the the experience. And then there's the third person perspective on the world. Right. And so to to man, science from Applying scientific rigor from a first person perspective is very difficult. I mean, it's fascinating. I think we can do it because it's also the thing, you know, what's really interesting is this, I think, it's not just first person. It's first and second. Right? Because science will because when so, like, one idea is that we, you know, the idea that, oh, science gives us this objective third person view. That's one way of talking about objectivity. There's a whole other way, is that, I do the experiment. You do the experiment. We talk to each other. We agree on methods, and we both get the same result. That is a very different way of thinking about objectivity. And it acknowledges that, you know, when we talk about agents, agency and individuality are flexible. Right? So there's a great paper for speak of Santa Fe by David Crackauer where they looked at sort of information theoretic measures of individuality. What you find is it's actually pretty fluid like my liver cell is an individual but really it's part of the liver and my liver is, you know, a separate system but really it's part of me. But I'm so I'm an individual. Yay. But actually, I'm part of a society, like and I I couldn't be me without the entire community of, say, language users. Right? I wouldn't even be able to frame any questions. And the my community of language users is part of ecosystems. Mhmm. Right? That are alive. That I am a part of a lineage of. This is like Sarah Walker stuff. And then that those ecosystems are part of the biosphere. Right? We're never separable as opposed to this very atomizing the triumphal, this science view. Is wants like boltsman brains? You're just brain floating in the space. You know? Yeah. There there is a fascinating degree to which agency's fluid. Like, you are an individual, but you and I talking is a kind of individual. Yeah. And then the person listening to this right now is also an individual. Right. I mean, that's a weird thing. That's a weird thing. Right? Because there's, like, there's a broadcast nature too. This is my information theoretic. So so the idea that we're pursuing now which I get really excited about, is this idea of information architecture. Mhmm. Right? Or organization, informational organization. Because, you know, right, physicalism is like, everything's atoms. But, you know, con rechecking. That con is apparently the one who came up with the word organism because he recognized that life has a weird organization that was seen specifically different from machines. And so this idea that how do we engage with the idea? That organization, which is often I can be cast in information theoretic terms, or computational terms even is sort of It's not really quite physical. Right? It's it's embodied in physical, you know, in the physical. It has to instantiate in the physical. But it also has this other realm of of design know, and so I'm not designed like intelligent design, but there's a you know, organization itself is is a relationship of constraints and information flow. And I think, again, that's an entirely new interesting way that we might get a very different kind of science that would flow out of that. So going back to cod and organism versus machine. So I showed you a couple of legged robots. Very cool. Is it possible for machines to to have agency? I would not discount that possibility. I think, you know, there's no reason I would say that it's impossible that machines could whatever it manifests that strange loop that we're talking about, that auto poeces. I don't think there's a reason to say it can't happen in in silicon. I think whatever it would it would be very different from us. Like the idea that it would be like, oh, it would be just like us, but now it's instantiated. I think it might have very different kind of experiential nature. I don't think I don't think what we have now, like the LMs are really there. But but I yeah. I I I'm not gonna say that it's not possible. I wonder how far he can get with imitation, which is essentially what LLMs are doing. So imitating humans. And I I wouldn't discount either the possibility that through imitation you can achieve what you call consciousness or agency or the ability to have experience. Mhmm. I think for most of us humans to think, oh, that's just fake. That's copying. But there's some degree to which us we humans are just copying each other. We just are really good imitation machines. Yeah. Coming from babies who were born in this world and we're just learning to imitate each other and through the imitation and the tension in the disagreements in the imitations. We gain personality perspective, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. I think so I I, you know, it's possible. Right? It's possible. But I think probably the view I'm advocating would say that one of the most important parts of agency is there's something called e four. E four, the e four theory of cognition. Invodiment, inaction, embedding, and there's another one. Extension. But so the idea is that you actually have to be in a body, which is a self part of an environment that is the physical nature of it and of the of the extension in with other living systems as well, is essential. So that's why I think the LLMs are not gonna it's not just imitation. It's gonna require This goes to the brain and the VAT thing. I did an article about the brain and the VAT, which was really Evans. I was reporting on Evans. When they did the brain and the VAT, argument, but they said, look, in the end, actually, the only way to actually get a real brain into that is actually have a brain in a body. And if it could be a robot body, you know, but you still need a brain in the body. So I don't think LMs will get there because they can't you know, you really need to be embedded in a world. At least that's the e four. Idea. The e four, the four e approach to cognition argues the cognition does not occur solely in the head, but is also embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended, by way of extra cranial processes and structures. Though very much in vogue. Four e cognition has received relatively few critical evaluations. This is a paper. By reflecting our two recent collections, this article reduced the four e paradigm with a view to assessing the strengths and weaknesses is fascinating. I mean, yeah, the the branches of what is cognition extends far and it could go real far. Right. There's a great story about an interaction between Jonas Salk who is very much a reductionist, you know, the great biologist. And Gregory Bateson who was a cyberneticist. And Bateson always loved to poke people. And he said to Salk. He said, you know, where's your mind? And, you know, Salk went up here. And Bateson said, no. No. No. Out here. What he really meant was this extended idea. It's not just within your cranium to be to be to have experience. You know, experience in some sense is not a thing you have. It is a thing you do. Right? It's a it almost perform it in a way, which is why both actually having a body, but having the body itself be in a world with other bodies is, from this perspective, is really important. And it's very attracted to me and, you know, seeing, again, if we're really gonna do science with them, we're gonna have to, like, have these ideas crash up against data, you know, crash up against we can't just armchair it, you know, or or or, you know, or or or, you know, couch quarterbacking it. But I think there's a lot of possibility here. It's a very radically different way of looking at at at what we mean by nature? What do you make of the fact that this individual observer, you as an individual observer, only get a finite amount of time to exist in this world. Make you sad? No. Actually, it doesn't make me sad. So okay. So so, you know, full reveal. I have been doing contemplative practice in the Zen tradition for thirty years. I've been staring at a wall for thirty years. And it's taught me a lot. Right? You know, I really I I really value what that practice has given me about the nature of experience. And one of the things that taught me is like, you know, I don't really matter that very much. You know, this thing I call Adam Frank, is really, you know, it's kind of a construct, you know, there's this process going on, of which I am actually fundamentally. And that's super cool. But, you know, it's gonna go I don't know, I don't know where it came from. It's gonna go. I don't really need it to, you know, and then then who the hell knows? You know, I'm not I'm not a advocate for an afterlife. But just that, like, you know, what what I love Zen has this idea of beyond birth and death. And they don't mean reincarnation. What they mean is, dude, you don't even really understand what life is You know what I mean? Unlike this, you know, this core level of your own experience. So, you know, your ideas about what death is are equally ill formed. You know? And it's it's so, you know, the contemplative practice really tries to focus on experience itself like spend five days at a Zen session doing contemporary to practice from, you know, seven AM until nine PM, obviously, with breaks. And you'll really get a much deeper understanding of, like, what my own experience is? What does it really like? You you it forces you to learn how to stabilize your attention? Because, you know, attention is kinda like this thing. Like, it's usually just, like, up over there. Oh, my foot hurts. Oh, I gotta do my taxes. Oh, that, you know, what's that guy over there? Why is he wearing those stupid shoes? And with the contemporary practice, you learn how to stabilize it. And once you stabilize it, you can now begin to sort of explore the phenomenal nature of it. So what I think I've learned from that is, like, kinda whatever, you know. I'm not I'm not really kind of real to begin with. The Adam Frank port, the identity of the thing. And the the part of me that is real you know, everything's coming and going. It's all coming and going. Well, how could I ever not come and go when the entire world is just, you know, Buddhism has this idea of codependent arising. Nothing exists. Nothing has self nature. Nothing exists by itself. It's an endless infinitely connected web. But still, there's a deliciousness to the individual experience. You get attached to it, and it ends, and it's it's good, wild last, and it sucks that it ends. Like, can you can you be like, well, everything comes and goes, but, like, I was eating ice cream yesterday. Found this awesome low carb ice cream called delights here in Austin. And, you know, it ends. Yeah. And I was like and I was staring at the empty container and it was That's beautiful, man. I love that. You could say like, yeah. Wow. That's how it all is, but Can you say that that's all? What is it what I've learned from from because I I I love your idea of the deliciousness of it. Yeah. You know? But what I think happens with contemporary practice when it deepens is that it's not just you're not just saying. Right? This is why, you know, I thought I do colon practice. So this is a tradition in Zen that it was established. It was a teaching method that was established like a thousand years ago, these book of columns. And every con, you know, if you've ever read goodell as your buck, he's got a whole chapter on cones. They're kind of non logical problems that you have to work on. One of my favorite one was, stop the sound of the distant temple bell. You know, you're like, what? Every time my teacher gives it to him, like, what are you talking about? You know, this this whole Zen thing over like, up is down, but down is up, you must understand this. So, you know, your job with these cons is to sit with them. Is to sit with them until you sort of kinda, you know, you realize what the thing is trying to teach you, what aspect of experience it's trying to teach you. So there's no answer. There's no and in fact, actually, you don't give an answer. You actually usually have to demonstrate. The first time when I sat, you know, I did a call on and the guy was like, don't tell me the answer. Show me the answer. I was like, what are you talking about? But after doing these for years now, you know, I've kind of learned under learned the language of them. So I could never tell you. If I told you the answer, I could give you a call and tell you the answer, you'd be like, what? You know? It's never It's not the words. It's the buddhist. So, like, your experience of, like, yeah, the cup is empty. With a contemporary practice as it deepens over years, it really does take years. Just like anything in math that could be took me years to understand Lagrangian's. You kinda come to a deeper understanding with, like, yeah, the words of, like, It's not just like, oh, everything changes. You actually feel that movement. Like, you feel it with, like, breath to breath, you know? And it really becomes sometimes I have this feeling this is best up, but I'm just joy. And it's not connected to anything. Right? That's what I've kind of gotten from practice. It's just like, yeah, you know, that passage, that that infinite passage of moment to moment, that is truly the way things are. And it's okay. Like Matt, I'm okay because I have a feeling about it. Okay? I want it to be okay. It just is okay. It's a really it's a pretty awesome man. That's beautiful. Yeah. I I I maybe it's the genetics. Maybe it's the back chemistry of my brain, but I I generally have that joy about experience just Yeah. And morphous joy. But it seems like, again, maybe it's my Eastern European roots, but there's always like a mountain collie that's also sitting next to the joy. And I think it always feels like they're intricately linked So the melancholy is about maybe about the finiteness of experience, and the joy is just about Yeah. The beauty of experience and then just kinda sitting there. Yeah. Which is cool actually because that, you know, I'm also you know, I come from eastern. My my roots are eastern European as well. Going back. And I get it. Right? I mean, you know, the but that's also the cool thing. I think one of things is is, like, cable, that that is what it is. That is what it is. Right? You don't have to do anything. You don't have to, like, manipulate or move it around or, like, yeah, this is the experience. You know? Can you speak to those? Just the practical nature of sitting there seven AM to nine PM. I'm like, what the hell are you doing? What's what's powerful was fascinating to you? What have you learned from just the experience of just staring at a wall? Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, it's not really I mean, you're staring, you're facing a wall. And what you're doing is you're, you know, you're just sitting with you know, you can there's different meditative practices. Right? There's counting breaths. So that's usually what I do. I sit down, I start counting breaths. And for the first half hour, it's just like blah blah blah blah. I'm thinking like I said, I'm thinking about my taxes. I'm thinking about what I gotta do later on. Yada yada. Yada. First time I ever did a a full session, a two day session, I swear to God, I had Bruce Springsteen's born to run album track through from the beginning of the end with the pauses in the back and when they're LPs. Yeah. With the freaking noise. You know, because my mind was just like need to do something. So it literally played the whole album in order. That's pretty cool, actually. Yeah. Well, it's pretty amazing to see. You know, because you're really getting Do you see the dynamics of your mind? But what happens is And this took me a while. I used to I used to hate sitting. You know? I do it, but I After a while, the mind gets exhausted. Like, that part of the mind, the upper level though, the roof brain chatter is just like there's nothing else to do. And then you get bored. And I now I realize that's the that's when something interesting is gonna happen. Because you kinda like drop down. And now It's a very physical practice. People think you're just assuming you're not thinking or thinking about not thinking. Actually becomes a very physical process where you're really just following the breath, you're kind of riding the breath, and it gets very quiet. You know? And within that quietness you know, there's there's a path, you know, because obviously there's been Buddhism is always like, you know, you know, not about thinking. But there's a huge literature. So these guys are always about don't think. I've written all this stuff. But they're guideposts. They're like the finger pointing at the moon. And, you know, there's the idea first, you know, your mind is usually scattered. Right? Like, right now, when I walk out, I'm gonna go get the Uber and every mind's gonna be all over the place. But with sitting, first, you concentrate the mind so that there's no more scatter anymore. The thoughts are still happening, but you're just not there happening up there. You're not even paying attention to them. And then as time goes on, you unify the mind, which is this very powerful thing where kind of the self drops away, you know? And there's just this presence is kinda like a raw presence. And that's often where the the joy of up wells from. But you sit with whatever. Maybe you're gonna sit and you're gonna have, like, you know, maybe you're gonna go through like an hour of being bummed out about your mom who died or something. You know, you're just gonna sit with whatever comes up. You're gonna make the that's why the sitting part. You're making the commitment. I'm gonna sit here with whatever comes up. I will not be moved. And then what you come away with, it actually, over time, it actually changes kind of who you are. Like, I'm still the asshole I was from New Jersey, growing up. But I just have more space now for things, you know? Well, yeah. Once Jersey always Oh, it's Jersey. Well, I love the head prince the blue spring seems just blasting your head. Yeah. That was amazing. Why are we here? What do you think is the is the is the is the purpose the meaning of human existence? It's good that we just had the last conversation because I'm gonna give this answer which is so corny. It's love. And I'm not messing around because really actually what happened to you. So within Buddhism, there is the idea of the Buddhist Alpha principle. You're here to help. You're just here to help. Right? Compassion. Like, that's a really essential part of this path, of the dharma path. And when I first started, I was like, I don't care about compassion. I'm here for knowledge. Right? I'm here I know, I I started contemporary practice because of the usually I was suffering. I had, you know, the reason everybody comes things like this. You know, life was hard. Like, I was going through stuff. But I also wanted knowledge. I wanted to understand the foundational nature of reality. So I was like compassion or whatever. But then I found out that you can't get that. You can't get though. You can't go to this without compassion somehow in this process. You realize that it really is about helping all sentient beings. That's the way they train. You know, just just being here to to help. So I know that sounds corn ball. Especially for a guy from Jersey, which is like, you know, the main thing is to get over. Like, your job is to get over. But that's really what I found. It's still it is actually kinda and it's for that joy. The joy some of that joy is just it's like this. One of the things I have when I have, like, really, you know, there's a kind of experience I'll have in contemporary practice which will carry on to the world, which is just this gratitude for the fact that the world is just the world gives you everything. Mhmm. And there's a certain way. Right? Just the blue sky and the the breath, the world is just giving you itself completely unhindered. It holds nothing back. And, yeah, that's kind of the experience. And then you kinda like, oh, I need to be helpful because who's not having this experience, you know? So just love for the world as it is. Love for the world. And all the beings who are suffering, everybody's suffering. Everybody's suffering. You know, your worst political opponent, they're suffering. You know? And our job is just to try and drop our biases in our stories and see this fundamental level at which life is occurring. And hopefully, there's many alien civilizations out there going through the same journey out of suffering towards love. Yeah. That would you know, that may be a universal thing about what it means to be alive. I hope so. I hope so too. Either that or they're coming to eat us, especially if they're a type three civilization. That's right. And they got really big guns. Well, this was a truly mind blowing fascinating and just awesome conversation. Adam, thank you for everything you do, and thank you for talking to me. Oh, thank you. This was a lot of fun. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Adam Frank. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan. The cosmos is all that is, however was, however will be. Our feebless contemplation of the cosmos, stir us. There's a tingling in the spine, a catching the voice, a faint sensation as if a distant memory are falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
